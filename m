Thanks for CC'ing me - I faced this exact issue while working on my
(still not upstreamed) hd6446x PCMCIA controller driver. The PCMCIA
subsystem uses `inb/outb`, which expect the `sh_io_port_base` to be set
to something else than the default `-1`. At first I tried to set it to
`0xa0000000`, so that all I/O goes through the fixed, non-cacheable P2
area. That however broke some other driver code (I had no time to debug
which one). Eventually I ended up taking a suggestion from a MIPS PCMCIA
driver [1] and simply substract the broken `sh_io_port_base` address
from `HD64461_IOBASE`, as the base for `socket.io_offset`. This way all
the PCMCIA `inb/outb` accesses are absolute, no matter what the
`sh_io_port_base` is set to. This of course is a very ugly solution and
we should instead fix the root cause of this mess. I will have a better
look at this patch set and the problem at hand at a later date.

Cheers,
Artur
