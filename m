So "I guess setting PCI_IOBASE to zero is safer when you can't trust
drivers not to use inb()â€¦" in principle is true on other architectures
than sparc too, right? So do you think this means we shouldn't go with
Arnd's idea of making inb() just WARN_ONCE() if PCI_IOBASE is not
defined or just that for sparc defining it as 0 would be preferred?

As for s390 since we only support a limited number of drivers I think
for us such a WARN_ONCE() for inb() would be preferable.

I guess one option would be to let each architecture opt in to leaving
PCI_IOBASE undefined but in the first patch push PCI_IOBASE 0 into all
drivers that currently don't define it at all _and_ do not define their
own inb() etc.
