You want to stall this effort for *three months* to schedule a meeting?

I would love to have better profiling of memory allocations inside XFS
so that we can answer questions like "What's going on with these
allocation stalls?" or "What memory is getting used, and where?" more
quickly than we can now.

Right now I get to stare at tracepoints and printk crap until my eyes
bleed, and maybe dchinner comes to my rescue and figures out what's
going on sooner than I do.  More often we just never figure it out
because only the customer can reproduce the problem, the reams of data
produced by ftrace is unmanageable, and BPF isn't always available.

I'm not thrilled by the large increase in macro crap in the allocation
paths, but I don't know of a better way to instrument things.  Our
attempts to use _RET_IP in XFS to instrument its code paths have never
worked quite right w.r.t. inlined functions and whatnot.

From my outsider's perspective, nine months have gone by since the last
LSF.  Who has come up with a cleaner/better/faster way to do what Suren
and Kent have done?  Were those code changes integrated into this
patchset?  Or why not?

Most of what I saw in 2023 involved compiler changes (great; now I have
to wait until RHEL 11/Debian 14 to use it) and/or still utilize fugly
macros.

Recalling all the way back to suggestions made in 2022, who wrote the
prototype for doing this via ftrace?  Or BPF?  How well did that go for
counting allocation events and the like?  I saw Tejun saying something
about how they use BPF aggressively inside Meta, but that was about it.

Were any of those solutions significantly better than what's in front of
us here?

I get it, a giant patch forcing everyone to know the difference between
alloc_foo and alloc_foo_noperf offends my (yours?) stylistic
sensibilities.  On the other side, making analysis easier during
customer escalations means we kernel people get data, answers, and
solutions sooner instead of watching all our time get eaten up on L4
support and backporting hell.

I congratulate you on your memory of my kitchen mug.  Yes, that's what
it says.

Are you and Suren willing to pay whatever maintenance overhead there is?
