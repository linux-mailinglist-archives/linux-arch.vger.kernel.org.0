I think we can do it (but need to check).

LKL may use UML's drivers, and UML can also use LKL's devices/drivers
(as my 36/37 and 37/37 patches do, though the patches has no careful
consideration on IRQ handling).

As Anton mentioned, the IRQ handling needs to be considered in LKL, at
least. I need to check but there might be other factors.

Performance improve techniques (bulk operations, offload, etc) are
also applicable to both.  As UML can do, LKL can TSO/csum offload with
configured virtio-net devices.
