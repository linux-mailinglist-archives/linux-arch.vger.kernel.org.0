We have a requirement like yours, but ours seems more complex. We want to
isolate some memory regions from the VM's memory space and the start a child
process who will using these memory regions.

I've wrote a draft to support this feature, but I just find that my draft is
pretty like yours.

It seems that you've already abandoned this patchset, why ?
