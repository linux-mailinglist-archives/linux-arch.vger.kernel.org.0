Then I didn't explain my proposal clearly enough.  It doesn't require 
device driver authors to know anything about smp_load_acquire, 
smp_store_release, spinlocks, or mutexes.

Suppose an author wants to allocate and initialize a struct foo exactly 
once.  Then the driver code would contain something like this:

struct foo *foop;

static struct foo *alloc_foo(gfp_t gfp)
{
	... allocate and initialize ...
}

MAKE_ONCE_FUNC(struct foo, alloc_foo, (gfp_t gfp), (gfp))

The code to use it is:

	struct foo *p = once_alloc_foo(&foop, GFP_KERNEL);

If you don't like the global pointer, encapsulate it as follows:

struct foo *get_foo(grp_t gfp)
{
	static struct foo *foop;

	return once_alloc_foo(&foop, gfp);
}

and have users call get_foo instead of once_alloc_foo.

It's hard to imagine this getting much simpler.

The MAKE_ONCE_FUNC API is just as easy to understand and requires less 
boilerplate.  It's type-safe whereas your once_pointer structures 
aren't.  And it's more general, in the sense that it provides a way to 
call a function only once, as opposed to a way to store a pointer only 
once.
