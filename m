On AArch64 the TCR_EL1.TBI0 bit is set by default, allowing userspace
(EL0) to perform memory accesses through 64-bit pointers with a non-zero
top byte. However, such pointers were not allowed at the user-kernel
syscall ABI boundary.

With the Tagged Address ABI patchset, it is now possible to pass tagged
pointers to the syscalls. Relax the requirements described in
tagged-pointers.rst to be compliant with the behaviours guaranteed by
the AArch64 Tagged Address ABI.
