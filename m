And I finally got a working, building version updated and pushed out (again to):

  git@github.com:sean-jc/linux.git x86/upm_base_support

Took longer than expected to get the memslot restrictions sussed out.  I'm done
working on the code for now, my plan is to come back to it+TDX+SNP in 2-3 weeks
to resolves any remaining todos (that no one else tackles) and to do the whole
"merge the world" excersise.

Yeah, SNP needs similar treatment.  Sorting that out is high up on the todo list.
