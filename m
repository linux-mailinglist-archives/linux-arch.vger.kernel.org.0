We can't really expand later like you suggest.

Suppose in a couple of years that we need to add some new argument to
openat2 that isn't just a new flag. If all these values are passed by
individual arguments, you can't add one later without adding yet another
syscall.

Using a struct for this allows this to be extended later, OTOH. You can
extend it, and add a flag that tells the kernel that it can access the
new field. No new syscall required.
