So this is a rather strange usage of "maintenance overhead" :)

But it's something we thought of. If we had to plumb around a _RET_IP_
parameter, or a codetag pointer, it would be a hassle annotating the
correct callsite.

Instead, alloc_hooks() wraps a memory allocation function and stashes a
pointer to a codetag in task_struct for use by the core slub/buddy
allocator code.

That means that in your example, to move tracking to a given seq_file
function, we just:
 - hook the seq_file function with alloc_hooks
 - change the seq_file function to call non-hooked memory allocation
   functions.

Engineers don't prototype and benchmark everything as a matter of
course, we're expected to have the rough equivealent of a CS education
and an understanding of big O notation, cache architecture, etc.

The slub fast path is _really_ fast - double word non locked cmpxchg.
That's what we're trying to compete with. Adding a big globally
accessible hash table is going to tank performance compared to that.

I believe the numbers we already posted speak for themselves. We're
considerably faster than memcg, fast enough to run in production.

I'm not going to be switching to a design that significantly regresses
performance, sorry :)

You keep saying "maintenance burden", but this is a criticism that can
be directed at _any_ patchset that adds new code; it's generally
understood that that is the accepted cost for new functionality.

If you have specific concerns where you think we did something that
makes the code harder to maintain, _please point them out in the
appropriate patch_. I don't think you'll find too much - the
instrumentation in the allocators simply generalizes what memcg was
already doing, and the hooks themselves are a bit boilerplaty but hardly
the sort of thing people will be tripping over later.

TL;DR - put up or shut up :)
