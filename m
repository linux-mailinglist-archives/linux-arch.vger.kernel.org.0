What you are saying makes sense. But I can't say if we want to do a
global switch or not. I don't know how many existing users there are
(by users I mean automated testing b/c humans can switch for one-off
manual testing).

However, fail_nth that I mentioned is orthogonal to this. It's a
different mechanism to select the fault site that needs to be failed
(similar to what you mentioned as "interval/probability/ratelimit
stuff"). fail_nth allows to fail the specified n-th call site in the
specified task. And that's the only mechanism we use in
syzkaller/syzbot.
And I think it can be supported relatively easily (copy a few lines to
the "does this site needs to fail" check).

I don't know how exactly you want to use this new mechanism, but I
found fail_nth much better than any of the existing selection
mechanisms, including what this will add for specific site failing.

fail_nth allows to fail every site in a given test/syscall one-by-one
systematically. E.g. we can even have strace-like utility that repeats
the given test failing all sites in to systematically:
$ fail_all ./a_unit_test
This can be integrated into any CI system, e.g. running all LTP tests with this.

For file:line-based selection, first, we need to get these file:line
from somewhere; second, lines are changing over time so can't be
hardcoded in tests; third, it still needs to be per-task, since
unrelated processes can execute the same code.

One downside of fail_nth, though, is that it does not cover background
threads/async work. But we found that there are so many untested
synchronous error paths, that moving to background threads is not
necessary at this point.
