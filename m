A meeting wouldn't be out of the question, _if_ there is an agenda, but:

What's that coffeee mug say? I just survived another meeting that
could've been an email? What exactly is the outcome we're looking for?

Is there info that people are looking for? I think we summed things up
pretty well in the cover letter; if there are specifics that people
want to discuss, that's why we emailed the series out.

There's people in this thread who've used this patchset in production
and diagnosed real issues (gigabytes of memory gone missing, I heard the
other day); I'm personally looking for them to chime in on this thread
(Johannes, Pasha).

If it's just grumbling about "maintenance overhead" we need to get past
- well, people are going to have to accept that we can't deliver
features without writing code, and I'm confident that the hooking in
particular is about as clean as it's going to get, _regardless_ of
toolchain support; and moreover it addresses what's been historically a
pretty gaping hole in our ability to profile and understand the code we
write.
