Yeah, that's not what I want. You're just tracing latency due to having more
processes runnable than CPUs.

I don't care about that for debugging, though! I specifically want latency at
the wait_event() level, and related - every time a process blocked _on some
condition_, until that condition became true. Not until some random, potentially
spurious wakeup.

Most of the time I _don't_ want full stacktraces, though!

That means I have a ton more output to sort through, and the data is far more
expensive to collect.

I don't know why it's what people go to first - see the page_owner stuff - but
that doesn't get used much either because the output is _really hard to sort
through_.

Most of the time, just a single file and line number is all you want - and
tracing has always made it hard to get at that.

...And the ad hominem attacks start.

Steve, I'm not attacking you, and there's room enough in this world for the both
of us to be doing our thing creating new and useful tools.

I would like to see more focus on usability.

That means, in a best case scenario, always-on data collection that I can just
look at, and it'll already be in the format most likely to be useful.

Surely you can appreciate the usefulness of that..?

Tracing started out as a tool for efficiently getting lots of data out of the
kernel, and it's great for that. But I think your focus on the cool thing you
built may be blinding you a bit to alternative approaches...
