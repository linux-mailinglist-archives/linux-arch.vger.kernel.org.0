Yes that's accurate: callbacks still need to handle partial ranges, so
it's more of a hint/optimization for cases where callbacks can benefit
from knowing the entire backing hugepage is being invalidated/freed.

Ok, yah, that's the approach I'm looking at for v9: pass the page/order
for invalidate_start, but keep invalidate_end as-is.

I actually ended up doing that for the v8 implementation, I figured it
was a holdover from before {REG,UNREG}_REGION were used, but too sure on
that so good to have some confirmation there.

It should happen in both places as long as it's possible for userspace
to fallocate(PUNCH_HOLE) a private page while it is mapped to a guest.
I'm not necessarily suggesting we should make any changes there right
now, but...

We might need to consider changing that if we decide that we don't want
to allow userspace to basically force splitting the directmap by always
issuing fallocate(PUNCH_HOLE) for each 4K page rather than trying to do
it in 2M intervals when possible, since it would still result in 4K
invalidations being issued, such that optimizations like restoring the
2M directmap can't be done, even when backed by THPs or hugetlbfs pages.
One approach to deal with this is to introduce a bitmap (for instance) to
track what subpages have been fallocate(PUNCH_HOLE)'d, and defer the
actual free'ing/invalidation until a whole page has been marked for
deallocation. This would keep huge-pages/huge-invalidations intact even
if userspace is malicious/non-optimal and actively trying to slow the
host down by forcing the directmap to get split.

*If* we took that approach though, then the MMU invalidations would also
get deferred, which is bad. But if we added a check/callback that
restrictedfd.c could use to confirm that the page is already in a
shared/non-private state, then we'd know the MMU invalidation for the
private page must have already happened, so if anything got faulted in
afterward it should be a shared page. (Though I guess update_mem_attr
would also need to check this bitmap and fail for cases where a
shared->private conversion is issued for a page/range that's been
recorded as having been previously issued a deferred PUNCH_HOLE'd.

But that's only an optimization and probably needs a lot more thought,
not necessarily something I think we need to implement now.
