<raises eyebrow>

Well, yes. Several times. I look at it almost daily, but that
doesn't mean it's approachable, easy to read or even -that I
understand what large parts of it say-. IOWs, that's one of the 
problematic documents that I've been saying have a huge learning
curve.

So, if I say "the LKMM documentation", I mean -all- of the
documentation, not just some tiny subset of it. I've read it all,
I've even installed herd7 so I can run the litmus tests to see if
that helps me understand the documentation better.

That only increased the WTF factor because the documentation of that
stuff is far, far more impenetrable than the LKMM documentation.  If
the LKMM learnign curve is near vertical, then the stuff in the
herd7 tools is an -overhang-. And I most certainly can't climb
that....

/me idly wonders if you recognise that your comment is, yet again, a
classic demonstration of the behaviour the "curse of knowledge"
cognitive bias describes.

It tries to teach people about what a memory model is at the same
time it tries to define the LKMM. What it doesn't do at all is
teach people how to write safe code. People want to write safe code,
not become "memory model experts".

Memory models are -your expertise- but they aren't mine. My
expertise is filesystems: I don't care about the nitty gritty
details of memory models, I just want to be able to write lockless
algorithms correctly. Which, I might point out, I've been doing for
well over a decade...

Haven't you understood anything I've been saying? That developers
don't care about how the theory behind the memory model  or how it
works - we just want to be able to write safe code. And to do that
quickly and efficiently. The "make the documentation more complex"
response is the wrong direction. Please *dumb it down* to the most
basic, simplest, common concurrency patterns that programmers use
and then write APIs to do those things that *hide the memory model
for the programmer*.

Adding documentation about all the possible things you could do,
all the optimisations you could make, all the intricate, subtle
variations you can use, etc is not helpful. It might be interesting
to you, but I just want -somethign that works- and not have to
understand the LKMM to get stuff done.

Example: I know how smp_load_acquire() works. I know that I can
expect the same behavioural semantics from smp_cond_load_acquire().
But I don't care how the implementation of smp_cond_load_acquire()
is optimised to minimise ordering barriers as it spins. That sort of
optimisation is your job, not mine - I just want a function that
will spin safely until a specific value is seen and then return with
acquire semantics on the successful load.....

Can you see the difference between "understanding the LKMM
documenation" vs "using a well defined API that provides commonly
used functionality" to write correct, optimal code that needs to
spin waiting for some other context to update a variable?

That's the problem the LKMM documentation fails to address. It is
written to explain the theory behind the LKMM rather than provide
developers with pointers to the templates and APIs that implement
the lockless co-ordination functionality they want to use....

Cheers,

Dave.
