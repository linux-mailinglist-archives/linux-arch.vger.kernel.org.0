Oh, hmm, yes, we aren't explicitly using SORT() here. Does that mean the
input sections were entirely be ordered in compilation unit link order,
even in the case of orphan sections? (And I think either way, the answer
isn't the same between bfd and lld.) I actually thought the like-named
input sections were collected together first with lld, but bfd strictly
appended to the output section. I guess it's time for me to stare at -M
output from ld...

Regardless, this patch is attempting to fix the problem where bfd and lld
lay out the orphans differently (as mentioned above, lld seems to sort
them in a way that is not strictly appended, and bfd seems to sort them
strictly appended). In the case of being appended to the .text output
section, this would cause boot failures due to _etext not covering the
resulting sections (which this[1] also encountered and fixed to be more
robust for such appended collection -- that series actually _depends_ on
orphan handling doing the appending, because there is no current way
to map wildcard input sections to their own separate output sections).

Looking at this again, I actually wonder if we have bigger issues here
with dead code elimination:

#ifdef CONFIG_LD_DEAD_CODE_DATA_ELIMINATION
#define TEXT_MAIN .text .text.[0-9a-zA-Z_]*
...

that would catch: .text.hot .text.fixup .text.unlikely and .text.unknown
but not .text.hot.*, etc (i.e. the third dot isn't matched, which is,
I assume, why Clang switched to adding a trailing dot). However, this
patch lists .text.hot .text.hot.* first, so they'd get pulled to the
front correctly, but the trailing ones (with 2 dots) would not, since
they'd match the TEXT_MAIN wildcard first. (This problem actually existed
before this patch too, and is not the fault of 9bebe9e5b0f3, but rather
the addition of TEXT_MAIN, which could potentially match .text.unlikely
and .text.fixup)

Unless I'm totally wrong and the bfd docs don't match the behavior? e.g.
if I have a link order of ".foo.before", ".foo.after", and ".foo.middle",
and this rule:

.foo : { *(.foo.before .foo.* .foo.after) }

do I get this (first match):

	.foo.before
	.foo.after
	.foo.middle

or (most specific match):

	.foo.before
	.foo.middle
	.foo.after

?

As I said, now that I'm able to better articulate these questions, I'll
go get answers from -M output. :)

Perhaps we need to fix TEXT_MAIN not TEXT_TEXT? TEXT_TEXT is for
collecting .text, .text.[^\.]* and *.text, where, effectively,
.text and .text[^\.]* are defined by TEXT_MAIN. i.e. adding 3-dot "text"
input sections needs to likely be included in TEXT_MAIN

Anyway, I'll keep looking at this...

(In the meantime, perhaps we can take Arvind's series, and the earlier
portions of the orphan series where asm-generic/vmlinux.lds.h and other
things are cleaned up...)
