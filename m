mshare + VA reservation is another possible solution.

Or MADV_DOEXEC alone, which is ready now.  I hope we can get back to reviewing that.

OK, mshare works on existing memory and builds a new vma.

Duplicating all the work that the kernel and loader do to exec a process would
be error prone, require ongoing maintenance, and be redundant.  Better to define 
a small kernel extension and leave exec to the kernel.
