Reading Elena's email, that's about preventing speculative loads. While
the arm64 Normal NC is non-cacheable (equivalent to write-combine), a
CPU is allowed to speculatively read from it. A carefully crafted gadget
could leave an imprint on a different part of the cache via speculative
execution based on a value in the secret memory. So IIUC, we want memory
that cannot be speculatively loaded from and that would be Device memory
on arm64 (with the alignment restrictions).

Now, I think we could relax this to Device_GRE. So maybe add a
pgprot_nospec() and allow architectures to define whatever they find
suitable. The exact semantics will be different between architectures.

Indeed, though as I said above, maybe use a name that suggests no
speculation since non-cacheable doesn't always guarantee that. Something
like pgprot_nospec() and SECRETMEM_NOSPEC.

However, your implementation still has the problem that such memory must
have the caches flushed before being mapped in user-space, otherwise we
leak other secrets via such pages to the caller. The only generic API we
have in the kernel for such things is the DMA one. If hch doesn't mind,
you could abuse it and call arch_dma_prep_coherent() prior to
set_direct_map_invalid_noflush() (if the mapping is non-cacheable).
