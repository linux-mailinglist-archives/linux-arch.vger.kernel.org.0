I prototyped your suggestion with this change to the device tree:

            reserved-memory {
                    #address-cells = <0x02>;
                    #size-cells = <0x02>;
                    ranges;

                    tags0: tag-storage@8f8000000 {
                            compatible = "arm,mte-tag-storage";
                            reg = <0x08 0xf8000000 0x00 0x4000000>;
                            block-size = <0x1000>;
                            memory = <&memory0>;
                            reusable;
                    };
            };

Would you mind explaining what we are gaining by using reserved mem?

Struct reserved_mem only has the base and size of the tag storage region,
and initialization for reserved mem happens before the DTB is unflattened.
When I prototyped using reserved mem, I still had to write the code to
parse the memory node address and size. This code was the same as the code
needed to parse the tag storage region address and size, so having that
information in struct reserved_mem does not reduce the size of the code by
a meaningful amount.

I am referring to arch/arm64/mm/init.c:: arm64_memblock_init(). The
function initializes reserved mem (in early_init_fdt_scan_reserved_mem())
**after**removing memory from memblock that the kernel cannot address.

This problem is caused by the kernel cannot using virtual addresses in the
linear map (where VA == PA) to access the tag storage region.
