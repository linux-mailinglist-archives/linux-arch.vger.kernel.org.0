Perhaps something like this:

	Specifically, if the only way to reach the initialized memory 
	involves dereferencing the pointer itself then READ_ONCE() is 
	sufficient.  This is because there will be an address dependency 
	between reading the pointer and accessing the memory, which will 
	ensure proper ordering.  But if some of the initialized memory 
	is reachable some other way (for example, if it is global or 
	static data) then there need not be an address dependency, 
	merely a control dependency (checking whether the pointer is 
	non-NULL).  Control dependencies do not always ensure ordering 
	-- certainly not for reads, and depending on the compiler, 
	possibly not for some writes -- and therefore a load-acquire is 
	necessary.

Perhaps this is more wordy than you want, but it does get the important 
ideas across.
