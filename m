This was in the context of your comment above about modifying
aarch64_insn_is_nop() - if we do that and nothing else then we'd remove
the current whitelisting.

Right.

Yes, Exception_SoftwareBreakpoint preserves PSTATE.BTYPE.

Obviously the main thing here is that if we miss faults then that's
potentially opening something that could be used as part of an exploit
chain.  I'm not aware of any sensible applications that would generate
the exceptions in normal operation.

Yes, or just accept the inaccurate fault address which isn't good but
might be the least worst thing if there's issues with reporting the
original address.

I think so, and as far as my ability to tell goes the worst consequence
would be missing exceptions like you say.  That's not great but it's at
least an extra hoop people have to jump through.
