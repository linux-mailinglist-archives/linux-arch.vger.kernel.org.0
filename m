Understood, but if the recipient does map at any of the same, which is the whole
point because you want to share the page table.  The trust relationship is no
different than for the live update case.

It does.  qemu registers memory with vfio which remembers the va's in kernel
metadata for the device.

qemu does not do the latter but that could be a nice way for apps to use
preserved memory.

It will be *far* more than 4 lines.
Much of the 200 lines is mostly for the elf opt in, and much of the elf code is from
anthony reviving an earlier patch that use MAP_FIXED_NOREPLACE during segment setup.
