From what you're saying, it seems that way. It would be really good to
get a reply from James to see whether he agrees - or at least get the
reason why this patch is in the series... but I suspect that will never
come.

I do know that James did a lot of testing, so maybe he found some
corner case somewhere which made this necessary - but without input
from James, we can't know that.

So, maybe the right way forward on this is to re-test the series
with this patch dropped, and see whether there's any ill effects.
It should be possible to resurect the patch if it does turn out to
be necessary.

Does that sound like a good way forward?

Thanks.
