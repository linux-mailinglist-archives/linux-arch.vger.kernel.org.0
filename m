I don't understand what you mean by "non-movable page starving issue as
CMA". Would you care to elaborate?

GFP_METADATA pages must be used only for movable allocations. The kernel
must be able to migrate GFP_METADATA pages (if they have been allocated)
when they are reserved to serve as tag storage for a newly allocated tagged
page.

If you are referring to the fact that GFP_METADATA pages are allocated only
when there are no more free pages in the zone, then yes, I can understand
that that might be an issue. However, it's worth keeping in mind that if a
GFP_METADATA page is in use when it needs to be repurposed to serve as tag
storage, its contents must be migrated first, and this is obviously slow.

To put it another way, the more eager the page allocator is to allocate
from GFP_METADATA, the slower it will be to allocate tagged pages because
reserving the corresponding tag storage will be slow due to migration.

Before making a decision, I think it would be very helpful to run
performance tests with different allocation policies for GFP_METADATA. But I
would say that it's a bit premature for that, and I think it would be best
to wait until the series stabilizes.

And thank you for the feedback!
