If I was an mm maintainer, I'd also question this ;). But vendors seem
pretty picky about the amount of RAM reserved for MTE (e.g. 0.5G for a
16G platform does look somewhat big). As more and more apps adopt MTE,
the wastage would be smaller but the first step is getting vendors to
enable it.

In general I'd expect the same characteristics. However, changing the
memory designation from tag to data (and vice-versa) requires some cache
maintenance. The allocation cost is slightly higher (not the runtime
one), so it would help if the page allocator does not favour this range.
Anyway, that's an optimisation to worry about later.

I think CXL+MTE is rather theoretical at the moment. Given that PCIe
doesn't have any notion of MTE, more likely there would be some piece of
interconnect that generates two memory accesses: one for data and the
other for tags at a configurable offset (which may or may not be in the
same CXL range).

I don't think adding CMA memory characteristics helps much. The metadata
allocation wouldn't go through cma_alloc() but rather
alloc_contig_range() directly for a specific pfn corresponding to the
data pages with PROT_MTE. The core mm code doesn't need to know about
the tag storage layout.

It's also unlikely for cma_alloc() memory to be mapped as PROT_MTE.
That's typically coming from device drivers (DMA API) with their own
mmap() implementation that doesn't normally set VM_MTE_ALLOWED (and
therefore PROT_MTE is rejected).

What we need though is to prevent vma_alloc_folio() from allocating from
a MIGRATE_CMA list if PROT_MTE (VM_MTE). I guess that's basically
removing __GFP_MOVABLE in those cases. As long as we don't have large
ZONE_MOVABLE areas, it shouldn't be an issue.

IIRC that was because PROT_MTE pages would have to come only from
!MOVABLE ranges. Maybe that's not such big deal.

We'll give this a go and hopefully it simplifies the patches a bit (it
will take a while as Alex keeps going on holiday ;)). In the meantime,
I'm talking to the hardware people to see whether we can have MTE pages
in the tag storage/metadata range. We'd still need to reserve about 0.1%
of the RAM for the metadata corresponding to the tag storage range when
used as data but that's negligible (1/32 of 1/32). So if some future
hardware allows this, we can drop the page allocation restriction from
the CMA range.

The current thinking is that the VM is not aware of the tag storage,
that's entirely managed by the host. The host would treat the guest
memory similarly to the PROT_MTE user allocations, reserve metadata etc.

Thanks for the feedback so far, very useful.
