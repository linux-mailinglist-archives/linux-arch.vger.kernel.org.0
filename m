Nothing is 100% reliable.

With printk() maintainer hat on, the current panic() implementation
is less reliable because it tries hard to provide some debugging
information, for example, error message, backtrace, registry,
flush pending messages on console, crashdump.

See panic() implementation, the reboot is done by emergency_restart().
The rest is about duping the information.

Well, the information is important. Otherwise, it is really hard to
fix the problem.

From my experience, especially the access to consoles is not fully
safe. The reliability might improve a lot when a lockless console
is used. I guess that using non-volatile memory for the log buffer
might be even more reliable.

I am not familiar with the code under emergency_restart(). I am not
sure how reliable it is.

If I wanted to implement a super-reliable panic() I would
use some external device that would cause power-reset when
the watched device is not responding.

PS: I do not believe much into the pkill approach as well.

    It is similar to OOM killer. And I always had to restart the
    system when it was triggered.

    Also kernel is not prepared for the situation that an external
    code kills a kthread. And kthreads are used by many subsystems
    to handle work that has to be done asynchronously and/or in
    process context. And I guess that kthreads are non-trivial
    source of WARN().
