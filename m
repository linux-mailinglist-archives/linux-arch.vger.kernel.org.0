For the namespace part, an idea I had and presented at LPC a while ago
was to make setns() interpret the nstype argument as a flag argument and
to introduce an fd that can refer to multiple namespaces at the same
time. This way you could do:

setns(namespaces_fd, CLONE_NEWNS | CLONE_NEWUSER | CLONE_NEWPID)

that could still be done. But I since have come to think that there's a
better way now that we have CLONE_PIDFD. We should just make setns()
take a pidfd as argument and then be able to call:

setns(pidfd, 0);

which would cause the calling thread to join all of the namespaces of
the process referred to by pidfd at the same time. That really shouldn't
be hard to do. I could probably get this going rather quickly and it
would really help out container managers a lot.

I have pitched an api like that a while ago (see [1]) - when I first
started this fd for processes thing - that would allow you to do things
like that. The gist was:

1. int pidfd_create aka CLONE_PIDFD now
   will return an fd that creates a process context. The fd returned by
   does not refer to any existing process and has not actually been
   started yet. So non-configuration operations on it or trying to
   interact with it would fail with e.g. ESRCH/EINVAL.
   
   We essentially have this now with CLONE_PIDFD. The bit that is missing
   is an "unscheduled" process.

2. int pidfd_config
   takes a CLONE_PIDFD and can be used to configure a process context
   before it is alive.
   Some things that I would like to be able to do with this syscall are:
   - configure signals
   - set clone flags
   - write idmappings if the process runs in a new user namespace
   - configure what happens when all procfds referring to the process are gone
   - ...
3. int pidfd_info
4. int pidfd_manage
   Parts of that are captured in pidfd_send_signal().

Just to get a very rough feel for this without detailing parameters right now:

/* process should have own mountns */
pidfd_config(fd, PROC_SET_NAMESPACE,  CLONE_NEWNS | CLONE_NEWPID | CLONE_NEWUSR, <potentially additional arguments>)

/* process should get SIGKILL when all procfds are closed */
pidfd_config(fd, PROC_SET_CLOSE, SIGKILL,     <potentially additional arguments>)

After the caller is done configuring the process there would be a final step:

pidfd_config(fd, PROC_CREATE, 0, <potentially additional arguments>)

which would create the process and (either as return value or through a
parameter) return the pid of the newly created process.

I had more thoughts on this and had started prototyping some of it but
then there wasn't much interest it seemed. Maybe because it's crazy.

I think that's somewhat similar to what I've suggested above.
