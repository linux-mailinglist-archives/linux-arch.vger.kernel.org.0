I generally agree with Ted's suggestion that we could merge the
easy-to-design part =E2=80=94 the VSTATUS+kerninfo =E2=80=94 first and deal=
 with the
SIGINFO part later. The only concern I have here is that the "later"
part might never practically arrive... :)

Still, some notes on the SIGINFO/userspace-status
part:

Some folks from linux-api@ claimed otherwise, but unfortunately didn't elab=

Not sure what you had in mind; in case you're suggesting that systemd has
to drop the sigpwr.target semantics =E2=80=94 it doesn't.
We don't need to ask systemd to drop sigpwr.target semantics.

To introduce SIGINFO =3D=3D SIGPWR to the kernel, the only "breaking" change
we have to do is to change the default disposition for SIGPWR, i. e. the
behaviour if the signal is set to SIG_DFL. If a process (including PID
1) installs its own signal handler for SIGPWR to do something when PWR
is received (or blocks the signal and handles it via signalfd
notifications), then the default disposition does not matter at all, as
Eric notes further in this thread.

=46rom a quick glance at systemd code, pid1's main() function calls
manager_new() calls manager_setup_signals(); this function, in turn,
blocks a set of signals, including PWR, and sets up a signalfd(2) on
that set. No changes have to be made in systemd, no need to remove the
sigpwr.target semantics.

The target activation does not send SIGPWR to anyone, it results in
systemd services being started and possibly stopped; the exact
consequences are out of scope for systemd.

There could be another concern: a VSTATUS keypress could result in
SIGINFO =3D=3D SIGPWR being sent to pid1. In a correct implementation this
will not ever happen, because a sane PID 1 does not have (and never
acquires) a controlling terminal.

All the possible surprises with the SIGINFO =3D=3D SIGPWR approach we might
get stem from here, not from the sigpwr.target.

To be fair, many programs are a lot younger than 4.3BSD, and with the
current ubiquity of Linux without VSTATUS, it's kind of a chicken-egg
problem. :)
