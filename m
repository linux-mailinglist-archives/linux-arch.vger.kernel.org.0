The 'allowed' protections seems answer my concern. But after we enabled
"NO_READ | NO_WRITE | NO_EXEC", are we going to check "NO_READ |
NO_WRITE | NO_EXEC" are also set together with the PRIVATE bit? I just
can't imagine what the semantic would be if we have the PRIVATE bit set
but other bits indicate it's actually can READ/WRITE/EXEC from usrspace.

A getter would be good, it might also be needed for live migration.

Do you have preference on using a new ioctl or just keep it as a cap?
E.g. KVM_CAP_MEMORY_ATTIBUTES can also returns a mask.

Dive into the implementation a bit, for KVM_GET_MEMORY_ATTRIBUTES we can
have different attributes for different pages in the same user-provided
range, in that case we will have to either return a list or just a error
number. Or we only support per-page attributes for the getter?
