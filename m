I'm not; I posted a long article about why I think it might be an 
alternative worth pursuing. I know, of course, Linus' long time hatred 
of C++, but as I said: I think *very recent* versions of C++ have a lot 
to offer, mainly in the form of metaprogramming (which we currently do 
using some amazingly ugly macros.)

Yes, that's one of the reasons for posting this.

Agreed... until it breaks again. And how much

Again, that would be a choice for the data consumer (backend), which is 
one of the main advantages here.
