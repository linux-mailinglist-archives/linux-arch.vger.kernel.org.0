Thank you for the detailed explanation and sorry for getting back late
at it. It seems like a pre-requisite for O_EMPTYPATH is to make it safe
and that depends on a patchset that Aleksa was working on. It would be
helpful to know the current status of that effort and if we could expect
it in the near future.

The repo[1] that was mentioned here[2] seems to be private. I am wondering
if there's a way to look at the patch somehow.
