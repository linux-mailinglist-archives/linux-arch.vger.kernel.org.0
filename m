I can have a follow-up patch that makes this do ni_syscall on x86_64
since we can go through the int 0x80 handler, or x32 handler path and
choose whichever one there.

My concern here would be something like DRM allocating memory and
returning a pointer to userspace that ends up in 64bit space.
I can see something like `drm_get_unmapped_area` calls in to
`current->mm->get_unmapped_area` which I believe only ends up falling
down TASK_SIZE checks.
Which could potentially return pointers in the 64bit address space
range in this case. Theoretically can be resolved either by thieving
the full 64bit VA range, or doing something like the Tango layer
patches that on syscall entry changes the syscall to a "compat"
syscall.
compat syscall flag like Tango might be nicer here?

I'll have a follow up patch that on 32bit hosts this is a ni_syscall instead

I tried having the dispatch table call directly in to the COMPAT one
and the way things were lining up weren't allowing me to do this.
Since this is a bit unique in how it operates, I'm not quite sure if
there is another example I could pull from for this.
