Yes, so on x86, we can use the default huge_ptep_get(). But for ARM64, 
unfortunately the A/D bits of a contig PTE is independent, that's why we 
want a ARM64 specific huge_ptep_get().

I hope the hardware can make sure the contPTE are always identical, 
however in fact like I said the A/D bits setting of a contig PTE by 
hardware is independent in a contig-PTE size hugetlb page, they are not 
always identical.

 From my testing, if I monitored a contig-PTE size hugetlb page with 
DAMON, and I only modified the subpages of the contig-PTE size hugetlb 
page. The result is I can not monitor any accesses, but actually there are.

So I think an ARM64 specific huge_ptep_get() implementation seems the 
right way as Muchun suggested?

Thanks.
