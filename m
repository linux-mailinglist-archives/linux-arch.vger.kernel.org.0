Yes.  Because having the signal set in real_blocked disables the
immediate kill optimization, and the signal has to be delivered before
we decide to kill the process.  Which matters because as you say if
nothing checks signal_pending() when the signals are unblocked we might
not attempt to deliver the signal.

So it is a matter of timing.

If we have both a signal and a file descriptor become ready
at the same time I would call that a race.  Either could
wake up the process and depending on the exact time we could
return either one.

So it is possible that today if the signal came just after the file
descriptor ,the code might have made it to restore_saved_sigmask_unless,
before __send_signal runs.

I see the concern.  I think in a matter like this we try it.  Make
the patches clean so people can bisect the problem.  Then if someone
runs into this problem we revert the offending patches.

If it looks like bisection won't cleanly reveal the potential problem
please let me know.

Personally I don't think anyone sane would intentionally depend on this
and I don't think there is a sufficiently reliable way to depend on this
by accident that people would actually be depending on it.

True.

The set of applications is larger than any developer can reasonably test.
