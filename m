Can you be more specific?  For example, exactly where does it start to 
become unapproachable or difficult to read?

Don't forget that this document was meant to help mitigate the LKMM's 
learning curve.  If it isn't successful, I want to improve it.

I can't argue with that.  Really understanding herd7 does require a 
pretty extensive background in the field.

Not at all.  I think you are confusing several different things.

For one, at a purely literal level my comment could not possibly be 
taken as a demonstration of "curse of knowledge" behavior, because it 
was a simple question: Have you seen explanation.txt?  Nothing obscure 
or outré about that.

For another, you appear to be confusing the LKMM with the kernel's API, 
and reference documents with programming guides (or recipes).  I'm sure 
that you aren't doing this deliberately and are well aware of these 
distinctions, but that's the impression your email leaves.

Of course it doesn't.  It was never meant to.  You can see this right in 
the filename "explanation.txt"; its purpose is to explain the LKMM.  
Nobody ever claimed it teaches how to write safe code or how to use the 
kernel's concurrent-programming API.  Those things belong in a separate 
document, such as recipes.txt.

Speak for yourself.  I personally want both, and no doubt there are 
others who feel the same way.

That's perfectly fine; I understand completely.  But your criticism is 
misplaced: It should be applied to recipes.txt, not to explanation.txt.

And remember: It was _you_ who claimed: "just understanding the 
vocabulary [the LKMM] uses requires a huge learning curve, and it's not 
defined anywhere".  explanation.txt shows that this statement is at 
least partly wrong.  Besides, given that you don't care about the nitty 
gritty details of memory models in any case, why are you complaining 
that understanding the LKMM is so hard?

My impression is that you really want to complain about the inadequate 
quality of recipes.txt as a programmers' guide.  Fine, but don't extend 
that to a blanket condemnation of all the LKMM documentation.

Again, speak for yourself.

In principle, both can be included in the same document.  Say, with the 
more in-depth discussions relegated to specially marked-off sections 
that readers are invited to skip if they aren't interested.

Certainly I can.  Can't _you_ see the difference between a document that 
helps people "understand the LKMM" and one that demonstrates "using a 
well defined API that provides commonly used functionality"?

That's the difference between a reference document and a programmers' 
guide.  Grousing that one isn't the other is futile.

On the other hand, pointing out specific areas of improvement for a 
document that was meant to be a programmers' guide can be very helpful. 
You may not be inclined to spend any time editing recipes.txt, but 
perhaps you could point out a few of the specific areas most in need of 
work?
