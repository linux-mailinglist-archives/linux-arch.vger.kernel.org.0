Still hard to say what is going on and what is at fault. But being
able to repro this in qemu helps debug quicker -- would you also be
able to share the precise rootfs.img, i.e. upload it somewhere I can
fetch it? And just to be sure, please also share your .config, as it
might have compiler-version dependent configuration that might help
repro (unlikely, but you never know).
