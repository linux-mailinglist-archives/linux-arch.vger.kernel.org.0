Eh, I would think that we could just do a text replacement in this case.
Or if that doesn't work, Coccinelle should be able to do this...

I don't think that we're at the "let's just put it in" stage. This is an
RFC version, so it should be fine to completely change the approach.
I agree, that we can't get it 100% right the first time, but we should
at least strive to get a good version.

I don't think that the idea was to "do the design later". I don't even
know how you would do that, since you need the design to submit a patch.

I can't offer you a complete API description, since that would require
me writing it up myself. But I would recommend trying to get it to work
with generics. I got a few other comments:
- I don't think that we should resort to a script to generate the Rust
  code since it prevents adding good documentation & examples to the
  various methods. AFAIU you want to generate the functions from
  `scripts/atomic/atomics.tbl` to keep it in sync with the C side. I
  looked at the git log of that file and it hasn't been changed
  significantly since its inception. I don't think that there is any
  benefit to generating the functions from that file.
- most of the documented functions say "See `c_function`", I don't like
  this, can we either copy the C documentation (I imagine it not
  changing that often, or is that assumption wrong?) or write our own?
- we should try to use either const generic or normal parameters for the
  access ordering instead of putting it in the function name.
- why do we need both non-return and return variants?

I think it is probably a good idea to discuss this in our meeting.
