Hello linux-arch

My boss Jean Maynard has asked me to contact you at once. He 
checked your profile and would like to collaborate with you on 
some project Email him at ( l3606436169@163.com ) for briefs and 
procedures because he has no LinkedIn account.

His representative is presently in your country and he will meet 
with you today after the briefs and procedures if you are 
interested.
