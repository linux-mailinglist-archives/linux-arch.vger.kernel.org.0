I'd say for consistency

I see.

Not sure how that flag is best encoded, but yes, it would have to be
somewhere that arch_get_unmapped_area() and
arch_get_mmap_end() can find. Clearly we want a solution that works
for both tango and for your work, as well as being portable to any
architecture.

For the asm-generic/unistd.h, you should be able to write htis as

#if __BITS_PER_LONG == 64
__SC_COMP(__NR_ioctl32, compat_sys_ioctl, sys_ni_syscall)
#endif

Which means that the native syscall in a 64-bit process always
points to compat_sys_ioctl, while a 32-bit process always gets
-ENOSYS.

Similarly, the syscall_64.tbl file on x86 and the other 64-bit
architectures would use
442    64      ioctl32         compat_sys_ioctl

FWIW, I suppose you can rename compat_sys_ioctl to
sys_ioctl32 treewide, if that name makes more sense.
