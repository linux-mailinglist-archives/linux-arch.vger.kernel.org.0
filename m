Yeah, execve is just the vector (though in this case it's done in order
to clear mm->dumpable). An earlier CVE (CVE-2016-9962) was very similar
but was attacking a dirfd that runc had open into the container (LXC had
a very similar bug too) -- setting !mm->dumpable was one of the
workarounds we had for this.

This is generally how we treat containers as runtime authors, but it's
not a trivial thing to get right. In many cases the kernel APIs are
working against you -- Christian and myself have written a fair few
patches to fix holes in the kernel APIs so we can avoid these kinds of
assumptions.

But yes, one of the most risky parts of a container runtime is when
you're attaching to a running container because all of the helpful
introspection APIs in /proc/ suddenly become a security nightmare. A
better "spawn a process in these namespaces" API might help improve the
situation (or at least, I hope it would).

I will try to send an RFC of the patchset I have for this next week or
so. Funnily enough, currently /proc/*/exe has the write bit set in its
"mode" (my series fixes this).
