Checking my understanding here about why we need this alignment check:

When KVM requests a page from restrictedmem, KVM will provide an offset
into the file in terms of 4K pages.

When shmem is configured to use hugepages, shmem_get_folio() will round
the requested offset down to the nearest hugepage-aligned boundary in
shmem_alloc_hugefolio().

Example of problematic configuration provided to
KVM_SET_USER_MEMORY_REGION2:

+ shmem configured to use 1GB pages
+ restrictedmem_offset provided to KVM_SET_USER_MEMORY_REGION2: 0x4000
+ memory_size provided in KVM_SET_USER_MEMORY_REGION2: 1GB
+ KVM requests offset (pgoff_t) 0x8, which translates to offset 0x8000

restrictedmem_get_page() and shmem_get_folio() returns the page for
offset 0x0 in the file, since rounding down 0x8000 to the nearest 1GB is
0x0. This is allocating outside the range that KVM is supposed to use,
since the parameters provided in KVM_SET_USER_MEMORY_REGION2 is only
supposed to be offset 0x4000 to (0x4000 + 1GB = 0x40004000) in the file.

IIUC shmem will actually just round down (0x4000 rounded down to nearest
1GB will be 0x0) and allocate without checking bounds, so if offset 0x0
to 0x4000 in the file were supposed to be used by something else, there
might be issues.

Hence, this alignment check ensures that rounding down of any offsets
provided by KVM (based on page size configured in the backing file
provided) to restrictedmem_get_page() must not go below the offset
provided to KVM_SET_USER_MEMORY_REGION2.

Enforcing alignment of restrictedmem_offset based on the currently-set
page size in the backing file (i.e. shmem) may not be effective, since
the size of the pages in the backing file can be adjusted to a larger
size after KVM_SET_USER_MEMORY_REGION2 succeeds. With that, we may still
end up allocating outside the range that KVM was provided with.

Hence, to be safe, we should check alignment to the max page size across
all backing filesystems, so the constraint is

     rounding down restrictedmem_offset to
     min(max page size across all backing filesystems,
         max page size that fits in memory_size) == restrictedmem_offset

which is the same check as

     restrictedmem_offset must be aligned to min(max page size across all
     backing filesystems, max page size that fits in memory_size)

which can safely reduce to

     restrictedmem_offset must be aligned to max page size that fits in
     memory_size

since "max page size that fits in memory_size" is probably <= to "max
page size across all backing filesystems", and if it's larger, it'll
just be a tighter constraint.

If the above understanding is correct:

+ We must enforce this in the KVM_SET_USER_MEMORY_REGION2 handler, since
   IIUC shmem will just round down and allocate without checking bounds.

     + I think this is okay because holes in the restrictedmem file (in
       terms of offset) made to accommodate this constraint don't cost us
       anything anyway(?) Are they just arbitrary offsets in a file? In
       our case, this file is usually a new and empty file.

     + In the case of migration of a restrictedmem file between two KVM
       VMs, this constraint would cause a problem is if the largest
       possible page size on the destination machine is larger than that
       of the source machine. In that case, we might have to move the
       data in the file to a different offset (a separate problem).

+ On this note, it seems like there is no check for when the range is
   smaller than the allocated page? Like if the range provided is 4KB in
   size, but shmem is then configured to use a 1GB page, will we end up
   allocating past the end of the range?
