Catching all historical state is pretty important in the case of memory
allocation accounting, don't you think?

Also, ftrace can drop events. Not really ideal if under system load your memory
accounting numbers start to drift.

The whole point of this is to be cheap enough to enable in production -
especially the latency tracing infrastructure. There's a lot of value to
always-on system visibility infrastructure, so that when a live machine starts
to do something wonky the data is already there.

What we've built here this is _far_ cheaper than anything that could be done
with ftrace.

I think perhaps some of the expectation should be on the "ftrace for
everything!" people to explain a: how their alternative could be even built and
b: how it would compare in terms of performance and ease of use.

Look, I've been a tracing user for many years, and it has its uses, but some of
the claims I've been hearing from tracing/bpf people when any alternative
tooling is proposed sound like vaporware and bullshitting.
