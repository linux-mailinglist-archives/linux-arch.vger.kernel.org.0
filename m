exec will be enhanced over time in the kernel.  A separate user space implementation
would need to track that.

Reimplementing exec in userland would be a big gross mess.  Not a good solution when
we have simple and concise ways of solving the problem.

I don't disagree.  But it is useful.  We already pass a block of data containing
environment variables and arguments from one process to the next.  Preserving 
additional segments is not a big leap from there.
