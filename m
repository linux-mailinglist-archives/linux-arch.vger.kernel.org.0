Ideally this would be better if we could pass the stack trace from one
event to the next, but that wouldn't be too hard to implement. It just
needs to be done.

But anyway:

 # echo 'p:wait prepare_to_wait_event' > /sys/kernel/tracing/kprobe_events

// created an event on prepare_to_wait_event as that's usually called just
// before wait event.

 # sqlhist -e -n wait_sched 'select start.common_pid as pid,(end.TIMESTAMP_USECS - start.TIMESTAMP_USECS) as delta from wait as start join sched_switch as end on start.common_pid = end.prev_pid where end.prev_state & 3'

// Create a "wait_sched" event that traces the time between the
// prepare_to_wait_event call and the scheduler. Only trigger it if the
// schedule happens in the interruptible or uninterruptible states.

 # sqlhist -e -n wake_sched 'select start.pid,(end.TIMESTAMP_USECS - start.TIMESTAMP_USECS) as delta2 from wait_sched as start join sched_switch as end on start.pid = end.next_pid where start.delta < 50'

// Now attach the wait_event to the sched_switch where the task gets
// scheduled back in. But we are only going to care if the delta between
// the prepare_to_wait_event and the schedule is less that 50us. This is a
// hack to just care about where a prepare_to_wait_event was done just before
// scheduling out.

 # echo 'hist:keys=pid,delta2.buckets=10:sort=delta2' > /sys/kernel/tracing/events/synthetic/wake_sched/trigger

// Now we are going to look at the deltas that the task was sleeping for an
// event. But this just gives pids and deltas.

 # echo 'hist:keys=pid,stacktrace if delta < 50' >> /sys/kernel/tracing/events/synthetic/wait_sched/trigger

// And this is to get the backtraces of where the task was. This is because
// the stack trace is not available at the schedule in, because the
// sched_switch can only give the stack trace of when a task schedules out.
// Again, this is somewhat a hack.

 # cat /sys/kernel/tracing/events/synthetic/wake_sched/hist
# event histogram
#
# trigger info: hist:keys=pid,delta2.buckets=10:vals=hitcount:sort=delta2.buckets=10:size=2048 [active]

Now we just need a tool to map the pids of the delta histogram to the pids
of the stack traces to figure out where the issues may happen.

The above is just to show that there's a lot of infrastructure already
there that does a lot of this work, but needs improvement. My theme to this
email is to modify what's there to make it work for you before just doing
everything from scratch, and then we have a bunch of stuff that only does
what we want, but is not flexible to do what others may want.

We could easily add a feature to limit how much you want to trace. Perhaps even
a skip level. That is, add skip and depth options to the stacktrace field.

That's what user space tools are for ;-)

Because we would need to store too much dwarf information in the kernel to
do so. But user space could do this for you with the function/offset
information.

Look, you keep making comments about the tracing infrastructure that you
clearly do not understand. And that is pretty insulting. Sorry, I'm not
sure you realize this, but those comments do turn people off and their
responses will start to become stronger.

You seem to push back hard when people suggest improving other utilities
to suite your needs.

Then lets make the current tools more usable. For example, the synthetic
event kernel interface is horrible. It's an awesome feature that wasn't
getting used due to the interface. This is why I created "sqlhist". It's
now really easy to create synthetic events with that tool. I agree, focus
on usability, but that doesn't always mean to create yet another tool. This
reminds me of:

I find "runtime turn on and off" better than "always on". We have
static_branches today (aka jump labels). I would strongly suggest using
them. You get them automatically from tracepoints . Even sched_stats are
using these.

I actually work hard to have the tracing infrastructure help out other
approaches. perf and bpf use the ftrace infrastructure because it is
designed to be modular. Nothing is "must be the ftrace way". I'm not against
the new features you are adding, I just want you to make a little more
effort in incorporating other infrastructures (and perhaps even improving
that infrastructure) to suite your needs.

If ftrace, perf, bpf can't do what you want, take a harder look to see if
you can modify them to do so.
