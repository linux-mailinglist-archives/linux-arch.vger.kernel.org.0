Hmm, but wouldn't that just be less work for you?

That is fine, but since we want to get generics in the future anyways, I
think it would be good to already implement them now to also gather
feedback on them.

The second counteractions would provide exactly the same API surface as
your non-generic version, so I don't see how going non-generic provides
any value over going generic.
The first approach was intended for a future in which we are not scared
of people using generic atomics in their structs. I don't know if we are
going to be in that future, so I think we should go with the second
approach for the time being.

I don't think that we need a script or a proc macro. A few declarative
macros probably suffice if we go the way of generics.

No that looks horrible.

Maybe there is something that we can do with generics, but I don't know
if it is worth it. I guess we can leave that open for the time being.
