There are a couple of additional use cases where having a consistent
memory interface with the kernel would be useful.

  - Xen DomU guests providing other domains with VirtIO backends

  Xen by default doesn't give other domains special access to a domains
  memory. The guest can grant access to regions of its memory to other
  domains for this purpose.=20

  - pKVM on ARM

  Similar to Xen, pKVM moves the management of the page tables into the
  hypervisor and again doesn't allow those domains to share memory by
  default.

  - VirtIO loopback

  This allows for VirtIO devices for the host kernel to be serviced by
  backends running in userspace. Obviously the memory userspace is
  allowed to access is strictly limited to the buffers and queues
  because giving userspace unrestricted access to the host kernel would
  have consequences.

All of these VirtIO backends work with vhost-user which uses memfds to
pass references to guest memory from the VMM to the backend
implementation.
