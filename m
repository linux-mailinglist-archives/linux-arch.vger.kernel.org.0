If I understand that correctly from the commit changelog, this would have
indeed helped, but if the change was reflected in format string. But with
string_get_size() it's always an %s and the change of the helper's or a
switch to another variant of the helper that would omit the space, wouldn't
be reflected in the format string at all? I guess that would be an argument
for Andy's suggestion for adding a new %pt / %pT which would then be
reflected in the format string. And also more concise to use than using the
helper, fwiw.
