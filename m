I'm still wondering what this supposed "maintenance overhead" is going
to be...

As I use this patch series I occasionally notice places where a bunch of
memory is being accounted to one line of code, and it would better be
accounted to a caller - but then it's just a couple lines of code to fix
that. You switch that callsite to the _noprof() version of whatever
allocation it's doing, then add an alloc_hooks() wrapper at the place
you do want it accounted.

That doesn't really feel like overhead to me, just the normal tweaking
your tools to get the most out of them.

I will continue to do that for the code I'm looking at, yes.

If other people are doing that too, it'll be because they're also using
memory allocation profiling and finding it valuable.

I did notice earlier that we're still lacking documentation in the
Documentation/ directory; the workflow for "how you shift accounting to
the right spot" is something that should go in there.
