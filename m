Petr, that is basically the common system design taken.

The whole challenge then remains to show that:

Once panic() was invoked, the watched device does not signal being
alive unintentionally, while the panic() is stuck in its shutdown
routines. That requires having a panic() or other shutdown routine
that still reliably can do something that the kernel routine that
makes the watched device signal does not signal anymore.
