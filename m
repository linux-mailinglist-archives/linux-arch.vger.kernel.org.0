That's pretty strage, I wonder if some kernel text cache line
effects come into play here?

The kernel access side is only used in slow path code, so it should
not make a difference, and the uaccess code is simplified and should be
(marginally) faster.

Btw, was this with the __{get,put}_user_allowed cockup that you noticed
fixed?
