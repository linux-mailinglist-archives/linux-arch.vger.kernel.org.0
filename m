Oh, this is half-baked.  I lost track of which flags were which.  What I intended
was a separate, initially-unused flags, e.g.

 struct kvm_memory_attributes {
	__u64 address;
	__u64 size;
	__u64 attributes;
	__u64 flags;
  }

so that KVM can tweak behavior and/or extend the effective size of the struct.

Not necessarily, e.g. I can see pKVM wanting to convert from RW+PRIVATE => RO+SHARED
or even RW+PRIVATE => NONE+SHARED so that the guest can't write/access the memory
while it's accessible from the host.

And if this does extend beyond shared/private, dropping from RWX=>R, i.e. dropping
WX permissions, would also be a common operation.

Hmm, typing that out makes me think that if we do end up supporting other "attributes",
i.e. protections, we should go straight to full RWX protections instead of doing
things piecemeal, i.e. add individual protections instead of combinations like
NO_EXEC and READ_ONLY.  The protections would have to be inverted for backwards
compatibility, but that's easy enough to handle.  The semantics could be like
protection keys, which also have inverted persmissions, where the final protections
are the combination of memslot+attributes, i.e. a read-only memslot couldn't be made
writable via attributes.

E.g. userspace could do "NO_READ | NO_WRITE | NO_EXEC" to temporarily block access
to memory without needing to delete the memslot.  KVM would need to disallow
unsupported combinations, e.g. disallowed effective protections would be:

  - W or WX [unless there's an arch that supports write-only memory]
  - R or RW [until KVM plumbs through support for no-exec, or it's unsupported in hardware]
  - X       [until KVM plumbs through support for exec-only, or it's unsupported in hardware]

Anyways, that's all future work...

They aren't irrelevant though, as the memory attributes are all describing the
allowed protections for a given page.  If there's a use case where userspace "can't"
keep track of the attributes for whatever reason, then userspace could do a RMW
to set/clear attributes.  Alternatively, the ioctl() could take an "operation" and
support WRITE/OR/AND to allow setting/clearing individual flags, e.g. tweak the
above to be: 
 
 struct kvm_memory_attributes {
	__u64 address;
	__u64 size;
	__u64 attributes;
	__u32 operation;
	__u32 flags;
  }

> I looked at kvm_device_attr, sounds we can do similar:

The device attributes deal with isolated, arbitrary values, whereas memory attributes
are flags, i.e. devices are 1:1 whereas memory is 1:MANY.  There is no "unset" for
device attributes, because they aren't flags.  Device attributes vs. memory attributes
really are two very different things that just happen to use a common name.

If it helped clarify things without creating naming problems, we could even use
PROTECTIONS instead of ATTRIBUTES.

As above, letting userspace set only a single attribute would prevent setting
(or clearing) multiple attributes in a single ioctl().

Definitely would need to communicate to userspace that various attributes are
supported.  That doesn't necessarily require a common ioctl(), but I don't see
any reason not to add a common helper, and adding a common helper would mean
KVM_CAP_PRIVATE_MEM can go away.  But it should return a bitmask so that userspace
can do a single query to get all supported attributes, e.g. KVM_SUPPORTED_MEMORY_ATTRIBUTES.  

As for KVM_GET_MEMORY_ATTRIBUTES, we wouldn't necessarily have to provide such an
API, e.g. we could hold off until someone came along with a RMW use case (as above).
That said, debug would likely be a nightmare without KVM_GET_MEMORY_ATTRIBUTES,
so it's probably best to add it straightway.

No need if the setter operates on all attributes.

Ah, right.
