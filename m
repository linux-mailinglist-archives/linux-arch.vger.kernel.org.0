Here we need to also solve the problem that without GET call we do not
have valid values for fsx_extsize, fsx_projid, and fsx_cowextsize. So
maybe we would need some flag in fsx_pad that fsx_extsize, fsx_projid,
or fsx_cowextsize are ignored/masked.

It is not great... But what about this? In a first step (part of this
syscall patch series) would be just a check that fsx_pad is zero.
Non-zero will return -EINVAL.

In next changes would added fsx_filter bit field, which for each
fsx_xflags and also for fsx_extsize, fsx_projid, and fsx_cowextsize
fields would add a new bit flag which would say (when SET) that the
particular thing has to be ignored.

So when fsx_pad is all-zeros then fsx_filter (first field in fsx_pad)
would say that nothing in fsx_xflags, fsx_extsize, fsx_projid, and
fsx_cowextsize is ignored, and hence behave like before.

And when something in fsx_pad/fsx_filter is set then it says which
fields are ignored/filtered-out.

I think that this starting to be more complicated to rebase my patches
in a way that they do not affect IOCTL path but implement it properly
for new syscall path. It does not sounds like a trivial thing which I
would finish in merge window time and having proper review and consensus
on this.
