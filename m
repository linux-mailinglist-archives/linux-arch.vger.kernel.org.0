As an illustration of the problems I'm having here, I was just writing
a reply to this with a suggestion of transforming this code ultimately
to:

	if (!get_cpu_device(pr->id)) {
		int ret;

		if (!invalid_logical_cpuid(pr->id) && cpu_present(pr->id))
			ret = acpi_processor_make_enabled(pr);
		else
			ret = acpi_processor_make_present(pr);

		if (ret)
			return ret;
	}

(acpi_processor_make_present() would be acpi_processor_hotadd_init()
and acpi_processor_make_enabled() would be arch_register_cpu() at this
point.)

Then I realised that's a bad idea - because we really need to check
that pr->id is valid before calling get_cpu_device() on it, so this
won't work. That leaves us with:

	int ret;

	if (invalid_logical_cpuid(pr->id) || !cpu_present(pr->id)) {
		/* x86 et.al. path */
		ret = acpi_processor_make_present(pr);
	} else if (!get_cpu_device(pr->id)) {
		/* Arm64 path */
		ret = acpi_processor_make_enabled(pr);
	} else {
		ret = 0;
	}

	if (ret)
		return ret;

Now, the next transformation would be to move !get_cpu_device(pr->id)
into acpi_processor_make_enabled() which would eliminate one of those
if() legs.

Now, if we want to somehow make the call to arch_regster_cpu() common
in these two paths, the next question is what are the _precise_
semantics of acpi_map_cpu(), particularly with respect to it
modifying pr->id. Is it guaranteed to always give the same result
for the same processor described in ACPI? What acpi_map_cpu() anyway,
I can find no documentation for it.

Then there's the question whether calling acpi_unmap_cpu() should be
done on the failure path if arch_register_cpu() fails, which is done
for the x86 path but not the Arm64 path. Should it be done for the
Arm64 path? I've no idea, but as Arm64 doesn't implement either of
these two functions, I guess they could be stubbed out and thus be
no-ops - but then we open a hole where if pr->id is invalid, we
end up passing that invalid value to arch_register_cpu() which I'm
quite sure will explode with a negative CPU number.

So, to my mind, what you're effectively asking for is a total rewrite
of all the code in and called by acpi_processor_get_info()... and that
is not something I am willing to do (because it's too far outside of
my knowledge area.)

As I said in my reply to patch 1, I think your comments on patch 2
make Arm64 vcpu hotplug unachievable in a reasonable time frame, and
certainly outside the bounds of what I can do to progress this.

So, at this point I'm going to stand down from further participation
with this patch set as I believe I've reached the limit of what I can
do to progress it.
