I thought BTI and PAC are already whitelisted in mainline as they fall
into the hint space (by whitelisting I mean you can probe them).

I'm trying to understand how the BTI patches affect the current uprobes
support and what is needed. Executing BTI or PCI?SP out of line should
be fine as they don't generate a BTI exception (the BRK doesn't either,
just the normal debug exception).

I think (it needs checking) that BRK preserves the PSTATE.BTYPE in SPSR.
If we probe an instruction in a guarded page and then we single-step it
in a non-guarded page, we'll miss a potential BTI fault. Is this an
issue?

If we are to keep the BTI faulting behaviour, we'd need an additional
xol page, guarded, and to find a way to report the original probed
address of the fault rather than the xol page.

So, IIUC, we don't have an issue with the actual BTI or PACI?SP
instructions but rather the other instructions that would not fault with
the BTI support. While we should try to address this, I think the
important bit now is not to break the existing uprobes support when
running a binary with BTI enabled.

Have I missed anything?
