Fair point, from reading I thought the main reason was share after
fork() but having an fd over exec() may be a good use-case too.
(Fwiw, this very much looks like what the memfd_create() api should have
looked like, i.e. mshare() could've possibly encompassed both.)

Well, we have use-cases for that too. E.g. where we need to attach to an
existing pid namespace which requires a first fork() of an intermediate
process so that the caller doesn't change the pid_for_children
namespace. Then we setns() to the target pid namespace in the
intermediate process which changes the pid_ns_children namespace such
that the next process will be a proper member of the target pid
namespace. Finally, we fork() the target process that is now a full
member of the target pid namespace. We also set CLONE_PARENT so
grandfather process == father process for the second process and then
have the intermediate process exit. Some fds we only ever open or create
after the intermediate process exited and some fds we can only open or
create after the intermediate process has been created and then send the
fds via scm (since we can't share the fdtable) to the final process.
