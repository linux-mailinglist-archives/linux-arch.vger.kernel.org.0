 Thanks for the heads-up, however the 0-DAY bot has caught this issue 
already last night and I would have addressed it earlier on if not for a 
failure of my Malta board :( which disrupted my verification.

 MIPSr6 doesn't have the original division instruction along with the MD 
accumulator registers anymore, and consequently GCC cannot fit the 
constraint requested.

 We don't need that asm however.  Maybe we didn't with GCC 2.95 either, 
but I suspect there was something to it.  Anyway I have just posted a fix.
