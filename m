smp_mb() is nowhere near the most expensive barrier we have in Linux,
mb() might qualify, since that has some completion requirements since it
needs to serialize against external actors.

On x86_64 things are rather murky, we have:

	LOCK prefix -- which implies smp_mb() before and after RmW
	LFENCE -- which used to be rmb like, until Spectre, and now it
		  is ISYNC like. Since ISYNC ensures an empty pipeline,
		  it also implies all loads are retired (and therefore
		  complete) it implies rmb.
	MFENCE -- which is a memop completion barrier like, it makes
		  sure all previously issued memops are complete.

if you read that carefully, you'll note you'll have to use LFENCE +
MFENCE to order against non-memops instructions.

But none of them imply dumping the instruction decoder caches, that only
happens on core serializing instructions like CR3 writes, IRET, CPUID
and a few others, I think we recently got a SERIALIZE instruction to add
to this list.


On ARM64 there's something a whole different set of barriers, and again
smp_mb() isn't nowhere near the top of the list. They have roughly 3
classes:

	ISB -- instruction sync barrier
	DMB(x) -- memory ordering in domain x
	DSB(x) -- memory completion in domain x

And they have at least 3 domains (IIRC), system, outer, inner.

The ARM64 __switch_to() includes a dsb(sy), just like PowerPC used to
have a SYNC, but since PowerPC is rare for only having one rediculously
heavy serializing instruction, we got to re-use the smp_mb() early in
__schedule() instead, but ARM64 can't do that.


So rather than say that x86 is special here, I'd say that PowerPC is
special here.

IIRC the membarrier SYNC_CORE use-case is about user-space
self-modifying code.

Userspace re-uses a text address and needs to SYNC_CORE before it can be
sure the old text is forgotten. Nothing the kernel does matters there.

I suppose the manpage could be more clear there.
