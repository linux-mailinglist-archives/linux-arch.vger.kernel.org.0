Here you go:

	https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/136281-t-opsem/topic/UB.20caused.20by.20races.20on.20.60.7Bread.2Cwrite.7D_volatile.60/near/399343771	

but maybe instead of Rust, LLVM is the best one to talk with on this.
Because my take from the communication with Rust folks is more like
"it's more up to LLVM on this".

(Now you mention that, once I was trying to construct a deadlock case
with some Rust code, but I couldn't since the locks are naturally
hierarchical because of the types, therefore it's impossible to reverse
the lock ordering. Yes, you still can have deadlocks in Rust, but that
hierarchial type trees really help a lot).

Right, that's field projection:

So we can play the type game as deep as we can, and I'm sure it'll be
helpful, but in the same time, having a reasonable
{read,write}_volatile() semantics on UB and races is also what we need.

Hey, in memory ordering model areas, we are supposed to work on these
rare cases ;-) These are building blocks for high level synchronization
constructions, so I'm entitled to complain ;-) But yes, to your point,
