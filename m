I think that, at this point, the task should be considered owned by the cont=
ainer.  Maybe we should have a better API than execve() to execute a program=
 in a safer way, but fiddling with dumpability seems like a band-aid.  In fa=
ct, the process is arguably pwned even *before* execve.

A better =E2=80=9Cspawn=E2=80=9D API should fix this.  In the mean time, I t=
hink it should be assumed that, if you join a container=E2=80=99s namespaces=
, you are at its mercy.

Cute.

I don=E2=80=99t see this as a problem.  Dumpable is about protecting a task f=
rom others, not about protecting a task against itself.

This is IMO the real bug.=
