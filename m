Thanks very much for doing this. Almost all of your comments are well
received, except for two cases that need more discussions which have
replied individually.

I have integrated this into my local TDX repo, with some changes (as I
replied individually), the new code basically still works with TDX.

I have also asked other TDX folks to take a look.

Appreciate your effort. As for the next steps, if you see something we
can do parallel, feel free to let me know.
