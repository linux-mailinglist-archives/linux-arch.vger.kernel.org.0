ARAB EMIRATES FOR INVESTMENT PROJECTS WITH MY OWN SHARE OF THE TOTAL
SUM OF THE MONEY. MEANWHILE, I DIDN'T FORGET YOU=E2=80=99RE PAST EFFORTS AN=
D
ATTEMPTS TO ASSIST ME IN TRANSFERRING THOSE FUNDS DESPITE THAT
EVERYTHING FAILED US SOMEHOW. NOW CONTACT MY SECRETARY IN BURKINA
FASO. MR. NELSON SALAH BY NAME: HIS E-MAIL nelson_salah@aol.com.

BELIEVE ONLY YOU KNOW HOW I MADE THIS MONEY SO TRY TO KEEP EVERYTHING
SECRET. I HOPE YOU UNDERSTAND THE REASON WHY THIS HUGE AMOUNT OF FUNDS
WAS KEPT FOR YOU? PLEASE DO LET ME KNOW IMMEDIATELY YOU RECEIVE THE
