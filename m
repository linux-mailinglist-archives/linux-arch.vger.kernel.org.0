I've been hoping that

c) using a mechanism such as [1] [2] where the goal is to group together
these small allocations that need to increase directmap granularity so
maximum number of large mappings are preserved. But I guess that means
knowing at allocation time that this will happen. So I've been wondering how
this would be possible to employ in the SNP/UPM case? I guess it depends on
how we expect the private/shared conversions to happen in practice, and I
don't know the details. I can imagine the following complications:

- a memfd_restricted region is created such that it's 2MB large/aligned,
i.e. like case a) above, we can allocate it normally. Now, what if a 4k page
in the middle is to be temporarily converted to shared for some
communication between host and guest (can such thing happen?). With the
punch hole approach, I wonder if we end up fragmenting directmap
unnecessarily? IIUC the now shared page will become backed by some other
page (as the memslot supports both private and shared pages simultaneously).
But does it make sense to really split the direct mapping (and e.g. the
shmem page?) We could leave the whole 2MB unmapped without splitting if we
didn't free the private 4k subpage.

- a restricted region is created that's below 2MB. If something like [1] is
merged, it could be used for the backing pages to limit directmap
fragmentation. But then in case it's eventually fallocated to become larger
and gain one more more 2MB aligned ranges, the result is suboptimal. Unless
in that case we migrate the existing pages to a THP-backed shmem, kinda like
khugepaged collapses hugepages. But that would have to be coordinated with
the guest, maybe not even possible?
