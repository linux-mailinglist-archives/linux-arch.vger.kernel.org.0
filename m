That sounds like the solution which I had here:

https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/1610729929-188490-2-git-send-email-john.garry@huawei.com/

It worked for the scenario I was interested in, but Arnd had some 
concerns, which you can check there.

I'm not sure how this would look in practice. What would the check for 
the suitable bus be?

Thanks,
