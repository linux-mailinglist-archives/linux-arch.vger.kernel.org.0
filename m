And Linus wants them gone entirely, so I'll need a stage fight between
the two of you.  At least for this merge window I'm only planning on
x86 and power, plus maybe riscv if I get the work done in time.  Although
helper from the maintainers would be welcome.  s390 has a driver that
still uses set_fs that will need some surgery, although it shouldn't
be too bad, but arm will be a piece of work.  Unless I get help it will
take a while.
