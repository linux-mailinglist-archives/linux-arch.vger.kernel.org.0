Have you seen tools/memory-model/Documentation/explanation.txt?  That
file was specifically written for non-experts to help them overcome the
learning curve.  It tries to define the vocabulary as terms are
introduced and to avoid using obscure syntax.

If you think it needs improvement and can give some specific details
about where it falls short, I would like to hear them.
