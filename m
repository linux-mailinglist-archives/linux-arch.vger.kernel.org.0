How about unsetting ALLOC_CMA if GFP_TAGGED ?
Removing __GFP_MOVABLE may cause movable pages to be allocated in un
unmovable migratetype, which may not be desirable for page fragmentation.

Could you explain what it means that PROT_MTE have to come only from
!MOVABLE range ? I don't understand this part very well.
