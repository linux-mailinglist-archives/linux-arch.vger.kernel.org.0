The underscore is a legitimate complaint - I brought this up in
development, not sure why it got lost. We'll do something better with a
consistent suffix, perhaps kmem_cache_alloc_noacct().

Well, isn't that part of the problem then? We're _this far_ into the
thread and still guessing on what Michal's "maintenance concerns" are?

Regarding your specific concern: My main design consideration was making
sure every allocation gets accounted somewhere; we don't want a memory
allocation profiling system where it's possible for allocations to be
silently not tracked! There's warnings in the core allocators if they
see an allocation without an alloc tag, and in testing we chased down
everything we found.

So if anyone later creates a new memory allocation interface and forgets
to hook it, they'll see the same warning - but perhaps we could improve
the warning message so it says exactly what needs to be done (wrap the
allocation in an alloc_hooks() call).

Sure, but complaints should say what they're complaining about.
Complaints so vague they could be levelled at any patchset don't do
anything for the discussion.
