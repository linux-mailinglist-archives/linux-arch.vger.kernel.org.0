Let me refresh some concepts first. VTLs are vCPU modes implemented by
the hypervisor. Lower VTLs switch into higher VTLs [1] through a
hypercall or asynchronously through interrupts. Each VTL has its own CPU
architectural state, lapic and MSR state (applies to only some MSRs).
These are saved/restored when switching VTLS [2]. Additionally, VTLs
share a common GPA->HPA mapping, but protection bits differ depending on
which VTL the CPU is on. Privileged VTLs might revoke R/W/X(+MBEC,
optional) access bits from lower VTLs on a per-GPA basis.

In order to deal with the per-VTL memory protection bits, we extended
the number of KVM address spaces and assigned one to each VTL. The
hypervisor initializes all VTLs address spaces with the same mappings
and protections, they are expected to diverge during runtime. Operations
that rely on memory slots for GPA->HPA/HVA translations (including page
faults) are already address space aware, so adding VTL support was
fairly simple.

Ultimately, when a privileged VTL enforces memory protections on lower
VTLs we update that VTL's address space memory regions to reflect them.
Protection changes are requested through a hypercall, which expects the
new protection to be visible system wide upon returning from it. These
hypercalls happen around 100000+ times during boot, so we introduced an
"atomic memory slot update" API similar to Emanuele's [3] that allows
splitting memory regions/changing permissions concurrent with other
vCPUs.

Now, if we had a way to map memory attributes to specific VTLs, we could
use that instead. Actually, we wouldn't need to extend address spaces at
all to support this (we might still need them to support Overlay Pages,
but that's another story).

Hope it makes a little more sense now. :)

Nicolas

[1] In practice we've only seen VTL0 and VTL1 being used. The spec
    supports up to 16 VTLs.

[2] One can draw an analogy with arm's TrustZone. The hypervisor plays
    the role of EL3. Windows (VTL0) runs in Non-Secure (EL0/EL1) and the
    secure kernel (VTL1) in Secure World (EL1s/EL0s).
