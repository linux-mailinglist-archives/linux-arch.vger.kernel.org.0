Ok.

If you think we should relax the documented semantic, I can go do that. If we
actually need the documented semantic in some cases, then something will need
to change.

All I'm really after is "what should the semantic be?" since there's clearly a
disconnect between the documentation and the code. I'm happy to go update
either.

I agree those are both necessary.

Fair enough.

Thanks,
