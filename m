I think what you're trying to achieve has nothing to do with the gap at 
all. (But do check out the IMM paper https://plv.mpi-sws.org/imm/ for 
what is involved in bridging the gap between LKMM-like and C11-like models).

What you're trying to achieve is to certify some urcu algorithms, 
without making the code unnecessarily slower.
Your problem is that the algorithm is implemented using the LKMM API, 
and you want to check it with a tool (TSAN) meant to (dynamically) 
analyze C11 code that relies on a subset of C11's memory model.

What I still don't understand is whether using TSAN as-is is a formal 
requirement from the certification you are trying to achieve, or whether 
you could either slightly modify the TSAN toolchain to give answers 
consistent with the behavior on LKMM, or use a completely different tool.

For example, you could eliminate the worry about the unnecessary 
barriers by including the extra barriers only in the TSAN' (modified 
TSAN) analysis.
In that case TSAN' adds additional, redundant barriers in some cases 
during the analysis process, but those barriers would be gone the moment 
you stop using TSAN'.

You would need to argue that this additional instrumentation doesn't 
hide any data races, but I suspect that wouldn't be too hard.

Another possibility is to use a tool like Dat3M that supports LKMM to 
try and verify your code, but I'm not sure if these tools are 
feature-complete enough to verify the specific algorithms you have in 
mind (e.g., mixed-size accesses are an issue, and Paul told me there's a 
few of those in (U)RCU. But maybe the cost of changing the code to 
full-sized accesses might be cheaper than relying on extra barriers.)


FWIW your current solution of adding a whole class of fences to 
essentially C11 and the toolchain, and modifying the code to use these 
fences, isn't a way I would want to take.

Not quite. If you rely on the LKMM API to generate the final code, you 
can definitely prove that the LKMM API implementation has a C11-like 
memory model abstraction.
For example, you might be able to prove that the LKMM implementation of 
a strong xchg guarantees at least the same ordering as a seq_cst fence ; 
seq_cst xchg ; seq_cst fence sequence in C11.
I don't think it's that fragile since 1) it's a manually written 
volatile assembler mapping, so there's not really a lot the toolchains 
can do about it and 2) the LKMM implementation of atomics rarely 
changes, and should still have similar guarantees after the change.

The main issue will be as we discussed before and below that TSAN will 
still trigger false positives.

I specifically meant the after_atomic fence from LKMM, which will 
compile to nothing on x86 (not even a compiler barrier).
However, at that point I also wasn't clear on what you're trying to 
achieve. I see now that using LKMM barriers doesn't help you here.

That's also a concern (although I thought they fixed that a year or two 
ago, but I must be mistaken).

What I mean is that even if TSAN appropriately used all fences for 
hb-analysis, and even if you added strong fences all over your code, 
there are (as far as I can see) still cases where TSAN will tell you 
there's a data race (on C11) but there isn't one on LKMM.


good luck
