The above comments... yea. As I didn't write the commit description, but
James did, and James has basically vanished, I don't think these can be
answered, short of rewriting the entire commit message, with me spending
a lot of time with the ACPI specification trying to get the terminology
right - because at lot of the above on the face of it seems to be things
to do with wrong terminology being used.

I wasn't expecting this level of issues with this patch set, and I now
feel completely out of my depth with this series. I'm wondering whether
I should even continue with it, since I don't have the ACPI knowledge
to address a lot of these comments.
