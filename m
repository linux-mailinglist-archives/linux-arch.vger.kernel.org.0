It goes back to what I said earlier about /memory nodes describing all
the memory. There's no reason to reserve memory if you haven't
described that range as memory to begin with. One could presumably
just have a memory node for each contiguous chunk and not need
/reserved-memory (ignoring the need to say what things are reserved
for). That would become very difficult to adjust. Note that the kernel
has a hardcoded limit of 64 reserved regions currently and that is not
enough for some people. Seems like a lot, but I have no idea how they
are (ab)using /reserved-memory.

Let me give an example. Presumably using MTE at all is configurable.
If you boot a kernel with MTE disabled (or older and not supporting
it), then I'd assume you'd want to use the tag storage for regular
memory. Well, If tag storage is already part of /memory, then all you
have to do is ignore the tag reserved-memory region. Tweaking the
memory nodes would be more work.


Also, I should point out that /memory and /reserved-memory nodes are
not used for UEFI boot.
