My understanding was this had been agreed with the toolchain folk a
while back -- anything static loaded by the kernel (i.e. a static
executable or the dynamic linker) would get GP set. In other cases the
linker will mess with the permissions on the pages anyhow, and needs to
be aware of BTI in order to do the right thing, so it was better to
leave it to userspace consistently (e.g. as that had the least risk of
subtle changes in behaviour leading to ABI difficulties).

I think it would be best to document the current behaviour, as it's a
simple ABI that we can guarantee, and the dynamic linker will have to be
aware of BTI in order to do the right thing anyhow.

Thanks,
Mark.
