Sure.  The whole community relies on you and others to provide a bug free exec.

Essentially you are saying you would argue against any enhancement to exec.
Surely that is too high a bar.  We must continue to evolve an innovate and
balance risk against reward.  This use case matters to our business a lot,
and to others as well, see below.  That is the reward.  I feel you are 
overstating the risk.  Surely there is some early point in the development
cycle of some release where this can be integrated and get enough test
time and soak time to be proven reliable.

I have having trouble see the difficulty.  Perhaps I am too familar with
it, but the semantics are few and easy to explain, and it does not introduce
new concepts: the post-exec process is born with a few more mappings than
previously, and non-fixed further mmaps choose addresses in the holes.

That's on us; we need to provide kernel tests and be diligent about testing
new releases.  This matters to our business and we will do so.

This is less resource intensive than live migration.  The latter ties up two
hosts, consumes lots of memory and network bandwidth, may take a long time
to converge on a busy system, and is unfeasible for guests with a huge amount
of local storeage (which we call dense I/O shapes).  Live update takes less than
1 second total, and the guest pause time is 100 - 200 msecs.  It is a very
attractive solution that other cloud vendors have implemented as well, with
their own private modifications to exec and and fork.  We have been independently
working in this area, and we are offering our implementation to the community.
