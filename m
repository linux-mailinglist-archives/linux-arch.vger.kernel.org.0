MAP_FIXED blows away any existing mapping in that range, which is not the 
desired behavior.  We want to preserve the previously created mapping at
the same VA and co-exist with other mappings created by the new process.
There is no way to guarantee availability of a VA post-exec.

Any mmap(MAP_ANON) segment can be preserved.  That is very general, and is 
the case we need to support to upgrade legacy applications that are already
running (such as qemu) -- we cannot recode them before they are updated.

The ELF opt-in flag must be set, so only selected executables will accept
incoming mappings.  The exec() code verifies that the preserved mappings 
do not overlap or become adjacent to text or stack, so it is not possible for
example for an attacker to cause stack underflow or overflow to access injected
content.  A gadget invoked by some other attack could access the preserved content.
