This sounds reasonable to me. Do you have any numbers on hand that would
show the impact of extending __ksymtab?

If I understand correctly, this is similar to the recently introduced
EXPORT_SYMBOL_FOR_MODULES() macro, but with a coarser boundary.

I think that if the goal is to control the kABI scope and limit the use
of certain symbols only to GKI modules, then having the protection
depend on whether the module is signed is somewhat odd. It doesn't give
me much confidence if vendor modules are unsigned in the Android
ecosystem. I would expect that you want to improve this in the long
term.

It would then make more sense to me if the protection was determined by
whether the module is in-tree (the "intree" flag in modinfo) or,
alternatively, if it is signed by a built-in trusted key. I feel this
way the feature could be potentially useful for other distributions that
care about the kABI scope and have ecosystems where vendor modules are
properly signed with some key. However, I'm not sure if this would still
work in your case.

I agree. I'm not aware of any other distribution that would immediately
need this feature, so it is good if the implementation is kept
reasonably straightforward and doesn't overly complicate the module
loader code.
