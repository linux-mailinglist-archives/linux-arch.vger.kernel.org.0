Masahiro, many thx for looking into this.

Because it looked like a regression that makes it harder for people and
CI systems to build and test mainline. To quote
Documentation/process/handling-regressions.rst (
https://docs.kernel.org/process/handling-regressions.html ):

"""
 * Fix regressions within two or three days, if they are critical for
some reason â€“ for example, if the issue is likely to affect many users
of the kernel series in question on all or certain architectures. Note,
this includes mainline, as issues like compile errors otherwise might
prevent many testers or continuous integration systems from testing the
series.
"""

I suspect that other distros rely on the build-id as well. Maybe I'm
wrong with that, but even if only Fedora and derivatives are effected it
will annoy some people. Sure, each can apply the revert, but before that
everyone affected will spend time debugging the issue first. A quick
revert in mainline (with a reapply later together with a fix) thus IMHO
is the most efficient approach afaics.

Ciao, Thorsten (wearing his 'the Linux kernel's regression tracker' hat)

P.S.: As the Linux kernel's regression tracker I deal with a lot of
reports and sometimes miss something important when writing mails like
this. If that's the case here, don't hesitate to tell me in a public
reply, it's in everyone's interest to set the public record straight.
