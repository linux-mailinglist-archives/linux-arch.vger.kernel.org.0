This is basically taking Linux and turning it into a whole new operating s=
ystem, while expecting the Linux kernel community to carry the support burd=
en thereof=2E

We have seen this before, notably with Xen=2E It is *expensive* and *painf=
ul* for the maintenance of the mainstream kernel=2E

Linux already has a notion of "kernel mode applications", they are called =
kernel modules and kernel threads=2E It seems to me that you are trying to =
introduce a user space compatibility layer into the kernel, with the only b=
enefit being avoiding the syscall overhead=2E The latter is bigger than we =
would like, which is why we are changing the x86 hardware architecture to i=
mprove it=2E

In my opinion, this would require *enormous* justification to put it into =
mainline=2E
