Nice!!!  Anything that I can/should know from that gathering?  ;-)

RSW from the infamous test6.pdf, correct?

Your x is RSW's z?

And your foo.x is RSW's x?  If so, the above WRITE_ONCE() could happen at
compile time, correct?  Or in the initialization clause of a litmus test?

Your ptr is RSW's y, correct?

A litmus tests can do this via the filter clause.

OK, same location, but RSW calls only for po, not addr from the initial
read to this read, got it.  (My first attempt left out this nuance,
in case you were wondering.)

And herd7/LKMM agree with this, at least assuming I got the litmus
test right.  (I used RSW's variables as a cross-check.)

Again, I leave the hardware specifics to the respective maintainers.

Agreed.  As soon as you add that second variable, you need more ordering.
The read-after-read ordering applies only within the confines of a single
variable, and you need more ordering when you add that second variable.
And as Will's RSW example shows, more ordering than you might think.

Just to join you guys in liking acquire and release better than smp_wmb()
and smp_rmb().  My RCU life got much better after update-side uses of
smp_wmb() were replaced by rcu_assign_pointer() and read-side uses of
smp_read_barrier_depends() were replaced by rcu_dereference().
