How about:

	There are also cases in which the smp_load_acquire() can be replaced by
	the more lightweight READ_ONCE().  (smp_store_release() is still
	required.)  Specifically, if the only way to reach the initialized
	memory involves dereferencing the pointer itself, then the data
	dependency barrier provided by READ_ONCE() is sufficient.  However, if
	some of the initialized memory is reachable some other way (for example,
	if it is global or static data) then there need not be an address
	dependency, merely a control dependency (checking whether the pointer is
	non-NULL).  READ_ONCE() is *not* sufficient in that case.

	The optimization of replacing smp_load_acquire() with READ_ONCE() is
	discouraged for nontrivial data structures, since it can be difficult to
	determine if it is correct.  In particular, for complex data structures
	the correctness of the READ_ONCE() optimization may depend on internal
	implementation details of other kernel subsystems.
