Oh, it is a little complicated.

Normally we have two address space limits, KERNEL_DS and USER_DS,
and they are supposed to be different.  armnommu and m68k define them
to the same value for no good reason.  That leads to:

uaccess_kernel always returning true as it does a positive check
agains KERNEL_DS, which disables a bunch of drivers like sg and
rdma, and could also lead to really strange and probably broken
results in a few places.

It also leads to the SIGKILL in addr_limit_user_check never
triggering due to the negat—ñve check, which is ok as the limits
never are different.
