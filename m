If I have an application that has a loop with a pselect call that
enables SIGINT (without a handler) and, for whatever reason,
one of the fd is always 'ready' then I'd expect a SIGINT
(from ^C) to terminate the program.

A quick test program:

#include <sys/time.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <unistd.h>

#include <sys/select.h>
#include <signal.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
        fd_set readfds;
        sigset_t sig_int;
        struct timespec delay = {1, 0};

        sigfillset(&sig_int);
        sigdelset(&sig_int, SIGINT);

        sighold(SIGINT);

        for (;;) {
                FD_ZERO(&readfds);
                FD_SET(0, &readfds);
                pselect(1, &readfds, NULL, NULL, &delay, &sig_int);

                poll(0,0,1000);
        }
}

Run under strace to see what is happening and send SIGINT from a different terminal.
The program sleeps for a second in each of the pselect() and poll() calls.
Send a SIGINT and in terminates after pselect() returns ERESTARTNOHAND.

Run again, this time press enter - making fd 0 readable.
pselect() returns 1, but the program still exits.
(Tested on a 5.1.0-rc5 kernel.)

If a signal handler were defined it should be called instead.

FWIW is ERESTARTNOHAND actually sane here?
If I've used setitimer() to get SIGALARM generated every second I'd
expect select() to return EINTR every second even if I don't
have a SIGALARM handler?
