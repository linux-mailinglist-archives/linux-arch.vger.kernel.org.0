The use-case I had in mind for the boot time reservation in secretmem is
a machine that runs VMs and there is a desire to have the VM memory
protected from the host. In a way this should be similar to booting a
host with mem=X where most of the machine memory never gets to be used
by the host kernel.

For such use case, boot time reservation controlled by the command
line parameter seems to me simpler than using CMA. I agree that there is
no way to use the reserved memory for other purpose, but then we won't
need to create physically contiguous chunk of several gigs every time a
VM is created.

The whole point of boot time reservation is to prevent splitting 1G
pages in the direct map. Allocating smaller chunks will still cause
fragmentation of the direct map.

Right, but I think if a user explicitly asked to use X gigabytes for the
secretmem we can allow that.
