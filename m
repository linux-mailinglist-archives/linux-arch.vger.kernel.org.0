Generics allow you to avoid code duplication (I don't think that you
want to create the `Atomic{I32,I64}` types via macros...). We would have
to do a lot of refactoring, when we want to introduce it. I don't see
the harm of introducing generics from the get-go.

Sure, just like Gary said, you can just do:

    impl Atomic<i32> {
        pub fn inc_unless_negative(&self, ordering: Ordering) -> bool;
    }

Or add a `HasNegative` trait.

I don't understand this point, why can't we put in the effort for a good
design? AFAIK we normally spend considerable time to get the API right
and I think in this case it would include making it generic.

I don't like that, why have two ways of doing the same thing? People
will be confused whether they should use `AtomicI32` vs `Atomic<i32>`...
