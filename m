Hello Christophe,

I would say that different systems have different requirements.
Not every Linux-based system needs live patching (it also has own limitations).

That's why I proposed a sysctl and didn't change the default kernel behavior.

I can't agree here. There is a very strong push against adding BUG*() to the 
kernel source code. So there are a lot of cases when WARN*() is used for severe 
problems because kernel developers just don't have other options.

Currently, it looks like there is no consistent error handling policy in the kernel.

Sorry, I see a contradiction.
If killing a process hitting a kernel warning is "dangerous and unrelevant",
why killing a process on a kernel oops is fine? That's strange.

Linus calls that behavior "fairly benign" here:

Alexander
