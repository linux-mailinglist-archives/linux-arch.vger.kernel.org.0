I would note that I have a solution in the making (which pretty much =
works)
for this matter, and does not require any kernel changes. It produces a
call stack that leads to the code that lead to syscall failure.

The way it works is by using seccomp to trap syscall failures, and then
setting ftrace function filters and kprobes on conditional branches,
indirect branch targets and function returns.

Using symbolic execution, backtracking is performed and the condition =
that
lead to the failure is then pin-pointed.

I hope to share the code soon.
