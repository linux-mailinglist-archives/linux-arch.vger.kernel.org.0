I'm fine as well. I wasn't trying to rush anything, but as I mentioned
below, I need some more design from people who want it to understand
whether that's a good idea.

Then I might mis-understand Gary? He said:

"Can we avoid two types and use a generic `Atomic<T>` and then implement
on `Atomic<i32>` and `Atomic<i64>` instead?"

, which means just replace `impl AtomicI32` with `impl Atomic<i32>` to
me.

We should work on things that are concrete, right? It's fine that the
design is not complete, and it's fine if you just recommend. But without
a somewhat concrete design (doesn't have to be complete), I cannot be
sure about whether we have the same vision of the future of generic
atomics (see my question to Gary), that's a bit hard for me to try to
work something out (plus I personally don't think it's a good idea, it's
OK to me, but not good). Anyway, I wasn't trying to refuse to do this
just based on personal reasons, but I do need to understand what you are
all proposing, because I don't have one myself.

I'll leave this to other atomic maintainers.

You're not wrong. AN in C side, we do have some documentation template
to generate the comments (see scripts/atomic/kerneldoc). But first the
format is for doxygen(I guess?), and second as you just bring up, the
templates are tied with the bash script.

Why is it important? Keeping it in the current way brings the value that
it's not too much different than their C counterparts. Could you explain
a bit the pros and cons on suffix vs const generic approach?

Historical reason I guess. Plus maybe some architectures have a better
implementation on non-return atomics IIRC.
