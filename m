You don't have to map at the same address to share the page tables.
For example, on x86 if you share an 8GB region, that must be aligned at
1GB in both the donor and the recipient, but they need not be mapped at
the same address.

It doesn't really matter how much of it is for the opt-in and how much
is for the exec path itself.  The MAP_FIXED_NOREPLACE patch is only net
+16 lines, so that's not the problem.
