It is over this that I walked away from progressing this code, because
I don't think it's quite as simple as you make it out to be.

Yes, acpi_map_cpu() and acpi_unmap_cpu() are already arch implemented
functions, so Arm64 can easily provide stubs for these that do nothing.
That never caused me any concern.

What does cause me great concern though are the finer details. For
example, above you seem to drop the evaluation of _STA for the
"make_present" case - I've no idea whether that is something that
should be deleted or not (if it is something that can be deleted,
then why not delete it now?)

As for the cpu locking, I couldn't find anything in arch_register_cpu()
that depends on the cpu_maps_update stuff nor needs the cpus_write_lock
being taken - so I've no idea why the "make_present" case takes these
locks.

Finally, the "pr->flags.need_hotplug_init = 1" thing... it's not
obvious that this is required - remember that with Arm64's "enabled"
toggling, the "processor" is a slice of the system and doesn't
actually go away - it's just "not enabled" for use.

Again, as "processors" in Arm64 are slices of the system, they have
to be fully described in ACPI before the OS boots, and they will be
marked as being "present", which means they will be enumerated, and
the driver will be probed. Any processor that is not to be used will
not have its enabled bit set. It is my understanding that every
processor will result in the ACPI processor driver being bound to it
whether its enabled or not.

The difference between real hotplug and Arm64 hotplug is that real
hotplug makes stuff not-present (and thus unenumerable). Arm64 hotplug
makes stuff not-enabled which is still enumerable.

... or at least that is my understanding which may not be entirely
correct (which is why I stepped down because I feel totally out of
my depth with ACPI stuff.)
