But this misses the real point: the majority of WARN conditions are in
device drivers checking expected device state against an internal state
model.  If this triggers it's a problem with the device not the thread,
so killing the thread is blaming the wrong party and making the
situation worse because it didn't do anything to address the actual
problem.

And what about the unexpected state?

Really, no, this is precisely wrong thinking.  If the condition were
recoverable it wouldn't result in a WARN.  There are some WARNs where
we think the condition is unexpected enough not to bother adding error
handling (we need these reporting so we know that the assumption was
wrong), but for most if there were a way to handle it we'd have built
it into the usual error flow.  What WARN means is that an unexpected
condition occurred which means the kernel itself is in an unknown
state.  You can't recover from that by killing and restarting random
stuff, you have to reinitialize to a known state (i.e. reset the
system).  Some of the reason we do WARN instead of BUG is that we
believe the state contamination is limited and if you're careful the
system can continue in a degraded state if the user wants to accept the
risk.  Thinking the user can handle the state reset locally by some
preset policy is pure fantasy: if we didn't know how to fix it at the
point it occurred, why would something far away from the action when
most of the information has been lost have a better chance?

Your only policy choices when hitting WARN are

   1. Accept the risk and continue degraded operation, or
   2. reset the system to a known good state.
