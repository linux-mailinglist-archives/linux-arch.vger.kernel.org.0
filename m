I do agree that the full stack trace is likely not what you need. But
the portion of the stack that you need is not really clear because the
relevant part might be on a different level of the calltrace depending
on the allocation site. Take this as an example:
{traverse, seq_read_iter, single_open_size}->seq_buf_alloc -> kvmalloc -> kmalloc

This whole part of the stack is not really all that interesting and you
would have to allocate pretty high at the API layer to catch something
useful. And please remember that seq_file interface is heavily used in
throughout the kernel. I wouldn't suspect seq_file itself to be buggy,
that is well exercised code but its users can botch things and that is
where the leak would happen. There are many other examples like that
where the allocation is done at a lib/infrastructure layer (sysfs
framework, mempools network pool allocators and whatnot). We do care
about those users, really. Ad-hoc pool allocators built on top of the
core MM allocators are not really uncommon. And I am really skeptical we
really want to add all the tagging source code level changes to each and
every one of them.

This is really my main concern about this whole work. Not only it adds a
considerable maintenance burden to the core MM because it adds on top of
our existing allocator layers complexity but it would need to spread beyond
MM to be useful because it is usually outside of MM where leaks happen.
