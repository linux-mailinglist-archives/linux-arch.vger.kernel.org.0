I still can't say I follow you here. If I reseve a CMA area as a pool
for secret memory 1G pages, it is still reserved and it still cannot be
used for other purposes, right?

That's what I tried to implement. The pool reserved at boot time is in a
way similar to booting with mem=X and then splitting the remaining
memory between the VMs.
In this case, the memory reserved at boot is never in the direct map and
allocations from such pool will not cause fragmentation.
