I went a bit nuts with openat_exec(), and I did end up adding it to the
ELF interpreter lookup (and you're completely right that this is a bad
idea -- I will drop it from this patch if it's included in the next
series).

The proposed solutions you give below are much nicer than this patch so
I can drop it and work on fixing those issues separately.

We could do PR_SET_DUMPABLE=3D3 for this, I guess?

This is something I'm currently working on a series for, which would
boil down to some restrictions on how re-opening of file descriptors
works through procfs.

However, execveat() of a procfs magiclink is a bit hard to block --
there is no way for userspace to to represent a file being "open for
execute" so they are all "open for execute" by default and blocking it
outright seems a bit extreme (though I actually hope to eventually add
the ability to mark an O_PATH as "open for X" to resolveat(2) -- hence
why I've reserved some bits).

(Thinking more about it, there is an argument that I should include the
above patch into this series so that we can block re-opening of fds
opened through resolveat(2) without explicit flags from the outset.)
