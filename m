No. I am mostly concerned about the _maintenance_ overhead. For the
bare tracking (without profiling and thus stack traces) only those
allocations that are directly inlined into the consumer are really
of any use. That increases the code impact of the tracing because any
relevant allocation location has to go through the micro surgery. 

e.g. is it really interesting to know that there is a likely memory
leak in seq_file proper doing and allocation? No as it is the specific
implementation using seq_file that is leaking most likely. There are
other examples like that See?

That is a memory overhead which can be really huge and it would be nice
to be more explicit about that in the cover letter. It is a downside for
sure but not something that has a code maintenance impact and it is an
opt-in so it can be enabled only when necessary.

Quite honestly, though, the more I look into context capturing part it
seems to me that there is much more to be reconsidered there and if you
really want to move forward with the code tagging part then you should
drop that for now. It would make the whole series smaller and easier to
digest.

It would have been more convincing if you had some numbers at hands.
E.g. this is a typical workload we are dealing with. With the compile
time tags we are able to learn this with that much of cost. With a dynamic
tracing we are able to learn this much with that cost. See? As small as
possible is a rather vague term that different people will have a very
different idea about.

I have tried our usual distribution config (only vmlinux without modules
so the real impact will be larger as we build a lot of stuff into
modules) just to get an idea:
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
28755345        17040322        19845124        65640791        3e99957 vmlinux.before
28867168        17571838        19386372        65825378        3ec6a62 vmlinux.after

Less than 1% for text 3% for data.  This is not all that terrible
for an initial submission and a more dynamic approach could be added
later. E.g. with a smaller pre-allocated hash table that could be
expanded lazily. Anyway not something I would be losing sleep over. This
can always be improved later on.

TBH I am much more concerned about the maintenance burden on the MM side
than the actual code tagging itslef which is much more self contained. I
haven't seen other potential applications of the same infrastructure and
maybe the code impact would be much smaller than in the MM proper. Our
allocator API is really hairy and convoluted.

Do you have any numbers?

Yes this sucks.

This would have been a nice argument to mention in the changelog so that
we know that you have considered that option at least. Why should I (as
a reviewer) wild guess that?

Thanks, that is certainly appreciated. I haven't looked deeper into that
part but from the cover letter I have understood that CONFIG_MEM_ALLOC_PROFILING
implies unconditional page_ext and therefore the memory overhead
assosiated with that. There seems to be a killswitch nomem_profiling but
from a quick look it doesn't seem to disable page_ext allocations. I
might be missing something there of course. Having a highlevel
describtion for that would be really nice as well.
