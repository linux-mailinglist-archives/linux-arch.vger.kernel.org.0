You asked me to provide the numbers in one of your replies, that's what I did.

The patchset is quite complete at this point. Instrumenting new
allocators takes 3 lines of code, see how kmalloc_hooks macro is used
in https://lore.kernel.org/all/20220830214919.53220-17-surenb@google.com/

You mentioned that memory consumption in the page_owner approach was
more important overhead, so I provided the numbers for that part of
the discussion.

Your comments in the last two letters about needing the stack tracing
and covering indirect users of the allocators makes me think that you
missed my reply here:
https://lore.kernel.org/all/CAJuCfpGZ==v0HGWBzZzHTgbo4B_ZBe6V6U4T_788LVWj8HhCRQ@mail.gmail.com/.
I messed up with formatting but hopefully it's still readable. The
idea of having two stage tracking - first one very cheap and the
second one more in-depth I think should address your concerns about
indirect users.
Thanks,
Suren.
