Your email would have been much better if you left the above line out. :-/
Comments like the above do not go over well via text. Even if you add the ":)"

Back to the comment about this being a burden. I just applied all the
patches and did a diff (much easier than to wade through 40 patches!)

One thing we need to get rid of, and this isn't your fault but this
series is extending it, is the use of the damn underscores to
differentiate functions. This is one of the abominations of the early
Linux kernel code base. I admit, I'm guilty of this too. But today I
have learned and avoid it at all cost. Underscores are meaningless and
error prone, not to mention confusing to people coming onboard. Let's
use something that has some meaning.

What's the difference between:

  _kmem_cache_alloc_node() and __kmem_cache_alloc_node()?

And if every allocation function requires a double hook, that is a
maintenance burden. We do this for things like system calls, but
there's a strong rationale for that. I'm guessing that Michal's concern
is that he and other mm maintainers will need to make sure any new
allocation function has this double call and is done properly. This
isn't just new code that needs to be maintained, it's something that
needs to be understood when adding any new interface to page
allocations.

It's true that all new code has a maintenance burden, and unless the
maintainer feels the burden is worth their time, they have the right to
complain about it.

I've given talks about how to get code into open source projects, and
the title is "Commits are pulled and never pushed". Where basically I
talk about convincing the maintainers that they want your change, and
not by pushing it because you want it.
