I don't think the games are avoidable. For one I found non-root
processes with non-empty cap_effective even on my laptop, albeit I did
not check how often something like this is doing access().

Discussion for another time.

I did not want to make such a change without redoing the ThunderX2
benchmark, or at least something else arm64-y. I may be able to bench it
tomorrow on whatever arm-y stuff can be found on Amazon's EC2, assuming
no arm64 people show up with their results.

Even then IMHO the safest route is to patch it out on x86-64 and give
other people time to bench their archs as they get around to it, and
ultimately whack the thing if it turns out nobody benefits from it.
I would say beats backpedaling on the removal, but I'm not going to
fight for it.

That said, does waiting for arm64 numbers and/or producing them for the
removal commit message sound like a plan? If so, I'll post soon(tm).
