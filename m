I think this gets into a quality of implementation.

I suspect that set_user_sigmask should do:
if (signal_pending())
	return -ERESTARNOSIGHAND; /* -EINTR that restarts if nothing was pending */

Which should be safe as nothing has blocked yet to consume any of the
timeouts, and it should ensure that none of the routines miss a signal.

I think the entire point is so that signals can be added to an event
loop in a race free way.  *cough* signalfd *cough*.  I think if you are
setting SIGINT to SIG_DFL you would leave SIGINT unblocked so it can
happen anywhere.

I can see more utility in having a SIGINT handler and you block SIGINT
except in your polling loop so you can do something deterministic when
SIGINT comes in.

Which makes it independent of my patches, but still worth fixing.
