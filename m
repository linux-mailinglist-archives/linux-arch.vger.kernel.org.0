Thanks, that clarifies things a lot.

So it sounds like you might want to provide that tag memory using CMA.

That way, only movable allocations can end up on that CMA memory area, 
and you can allocate selected tag pages on demand (similar to the 
alloc_contig_range() use case).

That also solves the issue that such tag memory must not be longterm-pinned.

Regarding one complication: "The kernel needs to know where to allocate 
a PROT_MTE page from or migrate a current page if it becomes PROT_MTE 
(mprotect()) and the range it is in does not support tagging.", 
simplified handling would be if it's in a MIGRATE_CMA pageblock, it 
doesn't support tagging. You have to migrate to a !CMA page (for 
example, not specifying GFP_MOVABLE as a quick way to achieve that).

(I have no idea how tag/tagged memory interacts with memory hotplug, I 
assume it just doesn't work)

Yes, some way of MM integration would be required. If CMA could get the 
job done, you might get most of what you need already.
