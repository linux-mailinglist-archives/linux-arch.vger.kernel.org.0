I completely agree. It's a shit-show, and it's caused by bad defaults in
Docker and (now) podman. To be fair, they both now support rootless
containers but the default is still privileged containers.

They do support user namespaces (though it should be noted that LXD's
support is much nicer from a security standpoint) but unless it's the
default the support is almost pointless. In the case of Docker it can
lead to some usability issues when you enable it (which I believe is the
main justification for it not being the default).

Yeah, the fact that we (runc) don't scream from the rooftops that this
setup is insecure is definitely a problem. I have mentioned this
whenever I've had a chance, but the fact that the most popular runtimes
(which use runc) don't use user namespaces compounds the issue. I'm
willing to bet that >90% of users of runc-based runtimes don't use user
namespaces at all, and this is all down to bad defaults.

There are also some other misfeatures we have in runc that we're
basically forced to support because some users use them, and we can't
really break entire projects (even though it's the projects' fault they
have an insecure setup).

I dropped this patch in v7, I don't think it's required for the
overarching feature. Looking back on it, it doesn't make much sense
given the context that privileged containers are unsafe in the first
place.

I do think that being able to block introspection might be a useful
hardening feature though. During attachment it would be nice to be sure
that nothing will be able to touch the attaching process's /proc/$pid --
even itself.
