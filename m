I can't speak for Dave, but the introduction to that documentation makes
it clear to me that it's not the document I want to read.

: This document describes the ideas underlying the LKMM.  It is meant
: for people who want to understand how the model was designed.  It does
: not go into the details of the code in the .bell and .cat files;
: rather, it explains in English what the code expresses symbolically.

I don't want to know how the model was designed.  I want to write a
device driver, or filesystem, or whatever.

Honestly, even the term "release semantics" trips me up _every_ time.
It's a barrier to understanding because I have to translate it into "Oh,
he means it's like an unlock".  Why can't you just say "unlock semantics"?
