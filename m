Thanks for summarizing!

Do you mean with more allocations in the codebase more codetags will
be generated? Is that the concern? Or maybe as you commented in
another patch that context capturing feature does not limit how many
stacks will be captured?

I experimented with using tracing with _RET_IP_ to implement this
accounting. The major issue is the _RET_IP_ to codetag lookup runtime
overhead which is orders of magnitude higher than proposed code
tagging approach. With code tagging proposal, that link is resolved at
compile time. Since we want this mechanism deployed in production, we
want to keep the overhead to the absolute minimum.
You asked me before how much overhead would be tolerable and the
answer will always be "as small as possible". This is especially true
for slab allocators which are ridiculously fast and regressing them
would be very noticable (due to the frequent use).

There is another issue, which I think can be solved in a smart way but
will either affect performance or would require more memory. With the
tracing approach we don't know beforehand how many individual
allocation sites exist, so we have to allocate code tags (or similar
structures for counting) at runtime vs compile time. We can be smart
about it and allocate in batches or even preallocate more than we need
beforehand but, as I said, it will require some kind of compromise.

I understand that code tagging creates additional maintenance burdens
but I hope it also produces enough benefits that people will want
this. The cost is also hopefully amortized when additional
applications like the ones we presented in RFC [1] are built using the
same framework.

1. The overhead.
2. Covers only page allocators.

I didn't think about extending the page_owner approach to slab
allocators but I suspect it would not be trivial. I don't see
attaching an owner to every slab object to be a scalable solution. The
overhead would again be of concern here.

I should point out that there was one important technical concern
about lack of a kill switch for this feature, which was an issue for
distributions that can't disable the CONFIG flag. In this series we
addressed that concern.
