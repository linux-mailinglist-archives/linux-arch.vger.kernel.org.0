I'm not an expert for the UML-arch, but based on this report I did some
investigations. I think that this patch might be partially in error.

Before the patch no constructors were called for UML and as a result
gcov-kernel profiling was not available, neither for built-in code nor
for module code.

With the patch CONFIG_CONSTRUCTORS was made available on UML and with it
gcov-kernel profiling. This works well for kernel modules (which I
assume is what Johannes tested), but it fails for built-in code. Note
that since UML does not specify ARCH_HAS_GCOV_PROFILE_ALL you need to
manually add GCOV_PROFILE := y to any kernel Makefile if you want to
enable profiling for that built-in code.

The subject patch is based on the assumption that constructors for
built-in kernel code is called from glibc when the vmlinux executable is
started. This does not work the way it was assumed it would, and would
be broken if it did.

It does not work because, as was already pointed out, glibc is looking
for the __init_array_start symbol to locate the list of constructor
function pointers, but the kernel uses a different symbol name
(__ctors_start). If you add the __init_array_start and _end symbols
glibc will call these functions correctly, but the kernel will crash.

The reason for the crash is that the kernel implementation of
__gcov_init() which is called from the constructors emitted by GCC's
gcov-profiling code assumes that base kernel facilities (such as printk)
have been initialized and are working as expected. Of course this is not
the case when the function is called by glibc before any kernel init
function was run.

I see multiple ways to go forward:

0. Do nothing

This patch doesn't break anything - it's just only partially effective
in that in enables gcov-kernel profiling for modules, but not for
built-in code.


1. Revert this patch

=> gcov-kernel profiling for kernel modules on UML would no longer work


2. Enable do_ctors() on UML

=> gcov-kernel profiling would work on UML for both kernel modules and
built-in code. There's a risk though that other constructors unrelated
to gcov might be called too late (I saw at least one
register_tm_clones() call while looking at the .init_array section of an
on UML executable). This risk is specific to UML code that runs before
start_kernel(). I'm not sure if there is anything there that consciously
relies on constructors.


3. Change gcov_init() to work without relying on kernel facilities and
add init_array_start and _end symbols to KERNEL_CTORS in
include/asm-generic/vmlinux.lds.h so that glibc can find and run
constructors before start_kernel(). Not sure if this is easily possible.
Certainly this is the option that results in the most amount of work.

=> gcov-kernel profiling would work on UML, any other constructors for
code run before start_kernel() would work, but this would also affect
other kernel code that relies on constructors (currently KASAN)... so
might also have further unwanted side-effects.


Any thoughts, comments or ideas for other alternatives?
