The description is very confusing to users that are also not filesystem
developers. "Structure needs cleaning" says what needs to be done but
not what happened. Unlike other error codes like "not enough memory",
"IO error" etc. We don't have EBUYMEM / "Buy more memory" instead of
ENOMEM.

Fuzzing tests and crafted images produce most of the EUCLEAN errors and
in this context "structure needs cleaning" makes even less sense.

EFSCORRUPTED is a appropriate name but to share the number with EUCLEAN
was a terrible decision and now every filesystem has to suffer and
explain to users what the code really means and point to the the sad
story when asked "So why don't you have a separate code?".

I wonder what userspace package really depends on the value, that would
eg. change code flow. Uncommon error values usually lead to a message
and exit.

Debian code search shows only jython, e2fsprogs, xfsprogs, python2.7,
pypy, linux, partclone using EFSCORRUPTED. So 2 of them are filesystem
packages that can handle that, python/jython only defines the value for
IRIX platform. The rest is linux kernel, not relevant.

So please give me one example where userspace will break.
