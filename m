Me neither, but while looking at a different project I did spot places
that actually do an access_ok with len 0, that's why I wanted him to
try.

That being said: Christophe are these number stables?  Do you get
similar numbers with multiple runs?

I'll have to leave that to the powerpc folks.  The intent was to not
change the behavior (and I even fucked that up for the the size == 0
case).

Except that we do not actually have such a patch.  For normal user
writes we only use ->write_iter if ->write is not present.  But what
shows up in the profile is that /dev/zero only has a read_iter op and
not a normal read.  I've added a patch below that implements a normal
read which might help a tad with this workload, but should not be part
of a regression.

Also Christophe:  can you bisect which patch starts this?  Is it really
this last patch in the series?
