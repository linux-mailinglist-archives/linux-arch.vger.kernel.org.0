I see the point.

LKL without drivers might be nothing, but let's see if this will end a
clean, and minimal viable patchset.

1) is not an option; we discussed this before not to have similar
archs in different directories.

# Richard, correct me if I'm wrong.

2) may be doable, the followings would be the list of things what we need:
- unify the driver codes
- unify interrupt handling, need to be x86/linux-independent
- unify thread model (i.e., struct thread_info)
- unify code scheduling  (e.g., __switch_to())
- unify memory management (mmu v.s. nommu)
- unify host interface (os_*() v.s. lkl_host_ops)
- support multiple syscall handlings (ptrace-based interception,
  direct func call, etc)
- (may still miss something..)

Those are actually the list of differences between UML and LKL.
And each item is inter-related: interrupt handling depends on how the
code/thread is executed, thread implementation interacts with memory
management, etc.

Thus for instance, unifying IRQ mechanism may involve several points
of the above list to be reorganized/reimplemented UML code to support
the library mode.  I thought this makes broader changes to UML, which
I was trying to avoid in v4 patch.

x86/linux only (LKL also has x86/win32 support).

The differences (and also conflicts) between UML and LKL are pretty
much the unification list of above 2).

The current LKL design assumes that there is only a single
process/application (but can have multiple threads) in a single LKL
kernel instance.

This assumption makes the design simple in several places of the
kernel:

- no memory protection across multiple users/processes needed
- no address space separation between user- and kernel-code

as a result, userspace code can directly call syscalls as function
calls.

This part is needed to expand more to support multiple processes
running/spawned (as UML does), which I mentioned the current LKL
doesn't have.

As for the interrupt handling, the currently LKL's interrupt is
triggered by the function call (lkl_trigger_irq or equivalent) while
UML's one is triggered by fd notification (epoll).
# LKL actually uses fd events but encapsulates into the lkl_host_ops.

So now we have three options for interrupt handling:
- use UML IRQ model in LKL (and UML)
- use LKL IRQ model in UML (and LKL)
- use two IRQ models (the current v4 patch)

I gave up to take the 1st approach as it drops host-independent
characteristics of LKL, thus took 3rd approach.  So to answer your
question, yes, it was needed to have a different IRQ model.

But maybe I should try the 2nd approach as well to avoid duplication.
I will conduct another experiment if this sounds the right direction.

I think the option 2) is the final goal.

okay.

I agree with this if the unification has all completed.
