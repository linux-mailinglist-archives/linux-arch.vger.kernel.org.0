You might not have seen the v8 of this set I sent a few days ago[1]. The
new set includes an example of a feature that is possible with
resolveat(2) but not with the current openat(O_PATH) interface. The
feature is that you can set RESOLVE_UPGRADE_NO{READ,WRITE} which then
blocks the re-opening of the file descriptor with those MAY_* modes.
(Though of course you might be against the entire idea of this feature
which allows for restricting the opening of magic-links.)

This can't be done with openat(2) without adding even more flags such as
O_PATH_UPGRADE_NOWRITE -- because O_RDONLY =3D 0, which means you can't
distinguish the "don't allow read or write" case (we could define 0x3
for that, but that feels a tad ugly). Not to mention that broken
userspace programs might already be setting O_PATH|O_RDWR.

So, while making it easier for userspace to be sure these flags are
working is one benefit, it's not the only reason. And outside arguments
for future features, several folks (some on-list, some on LWN) argued
that adding more "open" flags which aren't clearly related to the mode
the file is opened with makes not-much-more sense than a separate
syscall for it. Another (weaker) argument is that O_PATH should've been
separate from the beginning because of how unlike an ordinary fd it is.

Funnily enough, v8 does contain O_EMPTYPATH. However, this is just an
example of another /proc-less interface and we need it for O_PATH
descriptors even if you can do an full open in one shot with restricted
path resolution. Having an O_PATH can be useful on its own (LXC takes an
O_PATH of /dev/pts/ptmx inside the container and then re-opens it each
time a new console is required to avoid touching paths inside the
container).

But it would be neat to have a way for userspace to easily check what
flags the kernel honours, regardless of this patchset.

At the moment, I'm working on implementing userspace library wrappers
which use resolveat(2) for safe handling of an untrusted rootfs. I would
expect that most users of resolveat(2) would be using a library to
handle it -- because to do an "mkdir -p" you need to do a fair bit of
work for it to be safe unless we add LOOKUP_* flags to mkdirat(2) and
every other syscall. This is true whether or not openat(2) provides this
feature or if it's a separate syscall.

> Example *useful* system call attributes:

Sure, this would also work. I didn't know if anyone was open to the idea
of openat2(2). There is a follow-up question of how RESOLVE_UPGRADE_NO*
flags would be handled (they aren't obviously "lookup" flags so we'd
need to add more openat(2) flags to accommodate them) but I'm sure that
can be ironed out once you've taken a look at that patchset.

So something like

  resolveat(rootfd, "path/to/file", RESOLVE_IN_ROOT, &statbuf);

or

  openat2(rootfd, "path/to/file", O_PATH, RESOLVE_IN_ROOT, &statbuf);

? Is there a large amount of overhead or downside to the current
open->fstat way of doing things, or is this more of a "if we're going to
add more ways of opening we might as well add more useful things"?

I am glad that you agree with the general thrust, and it's just the
interface that is the hang-up.
