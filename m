Honestly, I wouldn't worry about us (arm64) here. I don't think any real
hardware implements the YIELD instruction (i.e. it behaves as a NOP in
practice). The only place I'm aware of where it _does_ something is in
QEMU, which was actually the motivation behind having it in cpu_relax() to
start with (see 1baa82f48030 ("arm64: Implement cpu_relax as yield")).

So, from the arm64 side of the fence, I'm perfectly happy just removing
the cpu_relax() calls from lockref.
