The problem is that without pretending a buffer is in user space when
it actually isn't, we can't have a generic fallback.  So we'll have to
have specific support - I wrote generic support for seq_file, and
willy did for /proc/sys, but at least the first caused a few problems
and a fair amount of churn, so I'd rather see first if we can get
away without it.
