This is a fair interpretation, but what prevents you from merging the
impls of functions that can be? I assumed that you would do that
automatically.

Sorry, which question?
Also to be aligned on the vision, I think we should rather talk about
the vision and not the design, since the design that we want to have now
can be different from the vision. On that note, what do you envision the
future of the atomic API?

I went back through the thread and here is what I think your argument
against generics is: people should think about size and alignment when
using atomics, which is problematic when allowing users to leave the
atomic generic.
But as I argued before, this is not an issue. Have I overlooked another
argument? Because I don't see anything else.

I see a bash script similarly to how Wedson sees proc macros ;)
We should try *hard* to avoid them and only use them when there is no
other way.

Reduce code duplication, instead of 3 different variants, we can have
one. It allows people to build ergonomic APIs that allows the user to
decide which synchronization they use under the hood.

Could we get some more concrete arguments for why we would need these in
rust? If the reason is purely historical, then we shouldn't expose the
non-return variant IMO. If it is because of performance, then we can
only expose them in the respective arches.
