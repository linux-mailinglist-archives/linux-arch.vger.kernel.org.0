Recipes are aimed at people who simply don't understand any of that
goobledegook. This won't help them -write correct code-.

You think they are important because you understand what those words
mean.  Large numbers of developers do not understand what they mean,
nor how to put them into practise correctly.

Seriously: if you want people to use this stuff correctly, you need
to -dumb it down-, not make it even more challenging by explaining
words people don't understand with yet more words they don't
understand...

This is the "curse of knowledge" cognative bias in a nutshell.
