If you can get the acks without any additional meetings, great. The 
replies from Pasha and Johannes are encouraging, let's hope core 
memory-allocator people will voice their opinion here.

If you come to the conclusion that another meeting would help getting 
maintainers's attention and sorting out some of the remaining concerns, 
feel free to schedule a meeting with Dave R. I suspect only the slot 
next week is already taken. In the past, we also had "special" meetings 
just for things to make progress faster.

If you're looking for ideas on what the agenda of such a meeting could 
look like, I'll happily discuss that with you off-list.

v2 was more than 3 months ago. If it's really about minor details here, 
waiting another 3 months for LSF/MM is indeed not reasonable.

Myself, I'll be happy not having to sit through another LSF/MM session 
of that kind. The level of drama is exceptional and I'm hoping it won't 
be the new norm in the MM space.

Good luck!
