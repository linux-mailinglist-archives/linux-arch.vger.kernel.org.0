Hi Sean,

In case you started working on the code again, I have a branch [1]
originally planned as v11 candidate which I believe I addressed all the
discussions we had for v10 except the very latest one [2] and integrated
all the newly added selftests from Ackerley and myself. The branch was
based on your original upm_base_support and then rebased to your
kvm-x86/mmu head. Feel free to take anything you think useful( most of
them are trivial things but also some fixes for bugs).

[1] https://github.com/chao-p/linux/commits/privmem-v11.6
[2] https://lore.kernel.org/all/20230413160405.h6ov2yl6l3i7mvsj@box.shutemov.name/
