Not really ;-) Committing to a generic interface without a vision/design
is going to be a maintenace nightmare. I will need to deal the soundness
issues and different ideas about what can be put in <..>. So I'd suggest
we take great caution before we make our decision, and I may even ask
for a formal proof of the soundness of a generic interface for key
components such as atomics. Because last time I check, safety is what
Rust brings on the table, right?

Someone may say that non generic atomics is one of the biggest mistakes
that Rust ever made. But I disagree. In fact when I saw this, my first
impression was "these guys know their stuff": there are only a few types
and operations that make sense, so putting them in a generic interface
would be over-engineer (at least at the beginning). It's better correct
than convenient/popular/aesthetical.

So would you and Gary be interested at working on such a design and
proof? Maybe someone else Cced would also be interested. Eventually we
will need the tool of soundness proof for other types as well, that's
going to be very vaulable. And having that would be the real "less work
for me" ;-)

Right now, I still plan to do in the current way (i.e. non-generic
atomcis for i32, i64, isize) because there are already users [1], 
the correctness is easy to confirm and we won't confuse users with
half-baked generic design. But should we have a sound Atomic<T> design,
I'm happy to adopt it ;-)

Not going to reply the above right now, because I'm leaning more
torwards switching when we have a sound Atomic<T> design, but I want you
to know I appreciate your input and explanation.

Ah right. And even without generics we could use some declarative
macros, and I'm happy to take a look at this and provide the alternative
approach so we can choose a better one.
