Page allocation tracepoints are not sufficient for what we're trying to do here,
and a substantial amount of effort in this patchset has gone into just getting
the hooking locations right - our memory allocation interfaces are not trivial.

That's something people should keep in mind when commenting on the size of this
patchset, since that's effort that would have to be spent for /any/ complete
solution, be in tracepoint based or no.

Additionally, we need to be able to write assertions that verify that our hook
locations are correct, that allocations or frees aren't getting double counted
or missed - highly necessary given the maze of nested memory allocation
interfaces we have (i.e. slab.h), and it's something a tracepoint based
implementation would have to account for - otherwise, a tool isn't very useful
if you can't trust the numbers it's giving you.

And then you have to correlate the allocate and free events, so that you know
which allocate callsite to decrement the amount freed from.

How would you plan on doing that with tracepoints?

Kmemleak is indeed expensive, and in the past I've had issues with it not
catching everything (I've noticed the kmemleak annotations growing, so maybe
this is less of an issue than it was).

And this is a more complete solution (though not something that could strictly
replace kmemleak): strict memory leaks aren't the only issue, it's also drivers
unexpectedly consuming more memory than expected.

I'll bet you a beer that when people have had this awhile, we're going to have a
bunch of bugs discovered and fixed along the lines of "oh hey, this driver
wasn't supposed to be using this 1 MB of memory, I never noticed that before".

So this is cool, I'll check it out today.

Tracing of /function/ latency is definitely something you'd want tracing/kprobes
for - that's way more practical than any code tagging-based approach. And if the
output is reliable and useful I could definitely see myself using this, thank
you.

But for data collection where it makes sense to annotate in the source code
where the data collection points are, I see the code-tagging based approach as
simpler - it cuts out a whole bunch of indirection. The diffstat on the code
tagging time stats patch is

 8 files changed, 233 insertions(+), 6 deletions(-)

And that includes hooking wait.h - this is really simple, easy stuff.

The memory allocation tracking patches are more complicated because we've got a
ton of memory allocation interfaces and we're aiming for strict correctness
there - because that tool needs strict correctness in order to be useful.

Yeah, if this is as far as people have gotten with ftrace on memory allocations
than I don't think tracing is credible here, sorry.

The next version of this patch set is going to use the alternatives mechanism to
add a boot parameter.

I'm not interested in backporting to older kernels - eesh. People on old
enterprise kernels don't always get all the new shiny things :)
