I have thought about it, but haven't got much further:  We can't couple
to SGX without a huge break in the current simple userspace API (it
becomes complex because you'd have to enter the enclave each time you
want to use the memory, or put the whole process in the enclave, which
is a bit of a nightmare for simplicity), and we could only couple it to
SEV if the memory encryption engine would respond to PCID as well as
ASID, which it doesn't.

The current use case for private keys is that you take an encrypted
file (which would be the DMA coupled part) and you decrypt the contents
into the secret memory.  There might possibly be a DMA component later
where a HSM like device DMAs a key directly into your secret memory to
avoid exposure, but I wouldn't anticipate any need for anything beyond
the usual page cache API for that case (effectively this would behave
like an ordinary page cache page except that only the current process
would be able to touch the contents).

Never say never, but current TEE designs tend to require full
confidentiality for the entire execution.  What we're probing is
whether we can improve security by doing an API that requires less than
full confidentiality for the process.  I think if the API proves useful
then we will get HW support for it, but it likely won't be in the
current TEE of today form.

Well, that was what the previous patch did.  I'm agnostic on the
mechanism for obtaining the fd: new syscall as this patch does or
extension to memfd like the old one did.  All I was saying is that once
you have the fd, the API you use on it is the same as the memfd API.
