The patchset is huge because it introduces a reusable part (the first
6 patches introducing code tagging) and 6 different applications in
very different areas of the kernel. We wanted to present all of them
in the RFC to show the variety of cases this mechanism can be reused
for. If the code tagging is accepted, each application can be posted
separately to the appropriate group of people. Hopefully that makes it
easier to review. Those first 6 patches are not that big and are quite
isolated IMHO:

That's fair.
For memory tracking I looked into using kmemleak and page_owner which
can't match the required functionality at an overhead acceptable for
production and pre-production testing environments. traces + BPF I
haven't evaluated myself but heard from other members of my team who
tried using that in production environment with poor results. I'll try
to get more specific information on that.

Thanks for pointing out this work. I'll need to review and maybe
profile it before making any claims.

I'm not sure how I can hook into say alloc_pages() to find out where
it was called from without capturing the call stack (which would
introduce an overhead at every allocation). Would love to discuss this
or other alternatives if they can be done with low enough overhead.
Thanks,
