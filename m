Can we not change aarch64_insn_is_nop() to actually return true only for
NOP and ignore everything else in the hint space? We tend to re-use the
hint instructions for new things in the architecture, so I'd rather
white-list what we know we can safely probe than black-listing only some
of the hint instructions.

I haven't assessed the effort of doing the above (probably not a lot)
but as a short-term workaround we could add the BTI and PAC hint
instructions to the aarch64_insn_is_nop() (though my preferred option is
the white-list one).
