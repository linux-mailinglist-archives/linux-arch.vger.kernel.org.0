I've tested this on both the Qemu-Virt machine as well as the
Allwinner Nezha board (with a D1 SoC).

Both of those are of course not necessarily the best platforms
for benchmarks I guess, as from what I gathered before I'd need
need multiple cores to actually get interesting measurements when
comparing different implementations. But at least everything that
worked before still works with this series ;-)


So, Series
