Yeah, I was trying to understand why systems were using binfmt_flat and
not binfmt_elf, given the mention of elf2flat -- is there really such a
large kernel memory footprint savings to be had from removing
binfmt_elf?

But regardless, yes, it seems like if you're doing anything remotely
needing shared libraries with binfmt_flat, such a system could just use
ELF instead.
