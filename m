Yes, this is exactly what I'm talking about. I'm not against your work, I
just want you to work more with everyone to come up with ideas that can
help everyone as a whole. That's how "open source communities" is suppose
to work ;-)

The histogram and synthetic events can use some more clean ups. There's a
lot of places that can be improved in that code. But I feel the ideas
behind that code is sound. It's just getting the implementation to be a bit
more efficient.

I picked prepare_to_wait() just because I was hacking up something quick
and thought that was "close enough" ;-)
