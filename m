Which matches what I see on a very old Linux system.

But is it what the standards mandate?
Can anyone check how Solaris and any of the BSDs behave?
I don't have access to any solaris systems (I doubt I'll get the disk to
spin on the one in my garage).
I can check NetBSD when I get home.

The ToG page for pselect() http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/pselect.html says:
    "If sigmask is not a null pointer, then the pselect() function shall replace
    the signal mask of the caller by the set of signals pointed to by sigmask
    before examining the descriptors, and shall restore the signal mask of the
    calling thread before returning."
Note that it says 'before examining the descriptors' not 'before blocking'.
Under the general description about signals it also says that the signal handler
will be called (or other action happen) when a pending signal is unblocked.
So unblocking SIGINT (set to SIG_DFL) prior to examining the descriptors
should be enough to cause the process to exit.
The fact that signal handlers are not called until 'return to user'
is really an implementation choice - but (IMHO) it should appear as if they
were called at the time they became unmasked.

If nothing else the man pages need a note about the standards and portability.
