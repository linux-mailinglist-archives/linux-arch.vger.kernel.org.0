Although I agree that the cat model needs updating and also that the Arm
ARM isn't helpful by trying to define DMB and DSB at the same time, it
does clearly state the following:

  // B2-149
  | A DSB instruction executed by a PE, PEe, completes when all of the
  | following apply:
  |
  | * All explicit memory accesses of the required access types appearing
  |   in program order before the DSB are complete for the set of observers
  |   in the required shareability domain.

  [...]

  // B2-150
  | In addition, no instruction that appears in program order after the
  | DSB instruction can alter any state of the system or perform any part
  | of its functionality until the DSB completes other than:
  |
  | * Being fetched from memory and decoded.
  | * Reading the general-purpose, SIMD and floating-point, Special-purpose,
  |   or System registers that are directly or indirectly read without
  |   causing side-effects.

Which means that the ASID read cannot return its data before the DSB ISHST
has completed and the DSB ISHST cannot complete until the PTE write has
completed.

Thanks! Do you want to queue it for 5.15? I don't think there's a need to
rush it into 5.14 given that we don't have any evidence of it happening
in practice.
