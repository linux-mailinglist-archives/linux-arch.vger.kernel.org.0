I don't know what happened to the orphans previously. But .text.hot and
.text.unlikely will now change ordering. It sounds from below like this
wasn't intentional? Though it does seem to be how BFD's default linker
scripts lay it out.

The existing comment on TEXT_TEXT mentions that issue. However, note
that the dead code stuff is only available currently on mips and ppc,
and is hidden behind EXPERT for those, so I'm not sure if anyone
actually uses it.

9bebe9e5b0f3 predates LD_DEAD_CODE_DATA_ELIMINATION, and there were no
wildcards I can see in .text at the time, which is why I don't
understand what problem is referred to in the commit message.

Btw, for the FGKASLR stuff, instead of keeping the output sections per
function, couldn't you generate a table of functions with sizes, and use
that when randomizing the order? Then the sections themselves could be
collected into .text explicitly.
