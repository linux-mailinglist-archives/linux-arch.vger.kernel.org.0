You're still using words that the target audience of the
documentation will not understand.

This is known as the "curse of knowledge" cognative bias, where
subject matter experts try to explain something to non-experts using
terms only subject matter experts understand....

This is one of the reasons that the LKMM documetnation is so damn
difficult to read and understand: just understanding the vocabulary
it uses requires a huge learning curve, and it's not defined
anywhere. Understanding the syntax of examples requires a huge
learning curve, because it's not defined anywhere. 

Recipes are *not useful* if you need to understand the LKMM
documenation to select the correct recipe to use. Recipes are not
useful if you say "here's 5 different variations of the same thing,
up to you to understand which one you need to use". Recipes are not
useful if changes in other code can silently break the recipe that
was selected by the user by carefully considering the most optimal
variant at the time they selected it.

i.e. Recipes are not for experts who understand the LKMM - recipes
are for developers who don't really understand how the LKMM all
works and just want a single, solid, reliable pattern they can use
just about everywhere for that specific operation.

Performance and optimisation doesn't even enter the picture here -
we need to provide a simple, easy to use and understand pattern that
just works. We need to stop making this harder than it should be.

So....

All good up to here - people will see this and understand that this
is the pattern they want to use, and DO_ONCE() is a great, simple
API that is easy to use.

What needs to follow is a canonical example of how to do it
locklessly and efficiently, without describing conditional use of it
using words like "initialised memory is transitively reachable" (I
don't know WTF that means!).  Don't discuss potential optimisations,
control flow/data dependencies, etc, because failing to understand
those details are the reason people are looking for a simple recipe
that does what they need in the first place ("curse of knowledge").

However, I think the whole problem around code like this is that it
is being open-coded and that is the reason people get it wrong.
Hence I agree with Willy that this needs to be wrapped in a simple,
easy to use and hard to get wrong APIs for the patterns we expect to
see people use.

And the recipes should doucment the use of that API for the
init-once pattern, not try to teach people how to open-code their
own init-once pattern that they will continue to screw up....

As a result, I think the examples should document correct use of the
API for the two main variants it would be used for. The first
variant has an external "inited" flag that handles multiple
structure initialisations, and the second variant handles allocation
and initialisation of a single structure that is stored and accessed
by a single location.

Work out an API to do these things correctly, then write the recipes
to use them. Then people like yourself can argue all day and night
on how to best optimise them, and people like myself can just ignore
that all knowing that my init_once() call will always do the right
thing.

This is the failure path, not the success. So it describing it as
pairing with "successful cmpxchg_release() above" when the code that
is executing is in the path where  the cmpxchg_release() above -just
failed- doesn't help anyone understand exactly what it is pairing
with.

This is why I said in that other thread "just saying 'pairs with
<foo>' is not sufficient to explain to the reader exactly what the
memory barrier is doing. You needed two full paragraphs to explain
why this was put here and that, to me, indicate the example and
expected use case is wrong.

But even then, I think this example is incorrect and doesn't fit the
patterns people might expect. That is, if this init function
-returned foo for the caller to use-, then the smp_load_acquire() on
failure is necessary to ensure the initialisation done by the racing
context is correct seen. But this function doesn't return foo, and
so the smp_load_acquire() is required in whatever context is trying
to access the contents of foo, not the init function.

Hence I think this example is likely incorrect and will lead to bugs
because it does not, in any way, indicate that
smp_load_acquire(&foo) must always be used in the contexts where foo
may accessed before (or during) the init function has been run...

Cheers,

Dave.
