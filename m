 From looking at the patch Niklas directed us at, as I understand, 
HAS_IOPORT is to decide whether the arch/platform may support PIO 
accessors - inb et al. And on that basis I am confused why it is not 
selected for arm64. And further compounded by:

  config INDIRECT_PIO
	 	bool "Access I/O in non-MMIO mode"
	 	depends on ARM64
	+	depends on HAS_IOPORT

If arm64 does not select, then why depend on it?

Assuming arm64 should select HAS_IOPORT, I am talking about f71805f as 
an example. According to that patch, this driver additionally depends on 
HAS_IOPORT; however I would rather arm64, like powerpc, should not allow 
that driver to be built at all.

Thanks,
John
