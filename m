The intent is that "transitively reachable" means that all initialized memory
can be reached by dereferencing the pointer in some way, e.g. p->a->b[5]->c.

It could also be the case that allocating the object initializes some global or
static data, which isn't reachable in that way.  Access to that data would then
be a control dependency, which a data dependency barrier wouldn't work for.

It's possible I misunderstood something.  (Note the next paragraph does say that
using READ_ONCE() is discouraged, exactly for this reason -- it can be hard to
tell whether it's correct.)  Suggestions of what to write here are appreciated.
