Hello good day
I've sent you an unanswered email twice. It is with confidence and
sincerity that I am contacting you, please accept my apologies if my email
violates your personal ethics. My name is Christian Kossi, I am a servant
lawyer based in Lom=C3=A9, Togo.

I am contacting you because of a surname similarity
to share with my deceased client, a citizen of your country who performed a
$ 9,600,000.00 bank deposit here in the Togolese Republic. Mans
The deceased customer died in a car accident on April 21, 2011, with
no close relatives are registered. Various efforts were made to find him
extended family through its embassy without results.

I received an official letter from the bank recommending the option
procedure for declaring the account unusable and confiscating within the Fu=

The amount is 9.6 million USD. According to government law here, after
At the end of the 10-year period, the fund will return to the
company's ownership
Togolese Government. The 10-year deadline just passed in April last year
2021, and no one has acted on your account or requested it
fund.

My suggestion to you is to present you to the bank as the nearest
a relative of my deceased client for the bank to pay these $ 9.6
millions to you as their recipient. Upon completion of the transfer,
I propose to divide the fund into a mutually agreed percentage, which will =
be
satisfactory to both parties and also to donate to charities.

I need your honest cooperation so that we can do that
transaction. I also guarantee that this will be done in accordance with a
a legal agreement that will protect you from any breach
law here or in your country.
