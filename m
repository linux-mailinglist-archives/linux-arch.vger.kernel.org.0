Thank you for the question.
For memory tracking my intent is to have a mechanism that can be enabled in
the field testing (pre-production testing on a large population of
internal users).
The issue that we are often facing is when some memory leaks are happening
in the field but very hard to reproduce locally. We get a bugreport
from the user
which indicates it but often has not enough information to track it. Note that
quite often these leaks/issues happen in the drivers, so even simply finding out
where they came from is a big help.
The way I envision this mechanism to be used is to enable the basic memory
tracking in the field tests and have a user space process collecting
the allocation
statistics periodically (say once an hour). Once it detects some counter growing
infinitely or atypically (the definition of this is left to the user
space) it can enable
context capturing only for that specific location, still keeping the
overhead to the
minimum but getting more information about potential issues. Collected stats and
contexts are then attached to the bugreport and we get more visibility
into the issue
when we receive it.
The goal is to provide a mechanism with low enough overhead that it
can be enabled
all the time during these field tests without affecting the device's
performance profiles.
Tracing is very cheap when it's disabled but having it enabled all the
time would
introduce higher overhead than the counter manipulations.
My apologies, I should have clarified all this in this cover letter
from the beginning.

As for other applications, maybe I'm not such an advanced user of
tracing but I think only
the latency tracking application might be done with tracing, assuming
we have all the
right tracepoints but I don't see how we would use tracing for fault
injections and
descriptive error codes. Again, I might be mistaken.

Thanks,
Suren.
