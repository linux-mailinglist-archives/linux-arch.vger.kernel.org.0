Dear Friend,

Please forgive me for stressing you with my predicaments as I know
that this letter may come to you as big surprise. Actually, as my
pastor advised me to reject earthly reward and thinks by handing the
project to someone I have never seen or met for a greater reward in
heaven awaits for whoever can give such a costly donation. I came
across your E-mail from my personal search, and I decided to email you
directly believing that you will be honest to fulfill my final wish
before or after my death.

 Meanwhile, I am Madam Elizabeth Edwards, 73 years, am from USA, still
childless. I am suffering from Adenocarcinoma Cancer of the lungs for
the past 8 years and from all indication my condition is really
deteriorating as my doctors have confirmed and courageously advised me
that I may not live beyond 2 weeks from now for the reason that my
tumor has reached a critical stage which has defiled all forms of
medical treatment.

Since my days are numbered, I=E2=80=99ve decided willingly to fulfill my
long-time vow to donate to the underprivileged the sum of Eighteen
million five hundred thousand dollars ($18.5m) I deposited in a
different account over 8 years now because I have tried to handle this
project by myself but I have seen that my health could not allow me to
do so anymore. My promise for the poor includes building of
well-equipped charity foundation hospital and a technical school for
their survival.

If you will be honest, kind and willing to assist me handle this
charity project as I=E2=80=99ve mentioned here, I will like you to provide =
me
your personal data like. Contact me through this email address
(elisabethe1981@mail.com) and also send me your private email address.

(1) Your full name:
(2) country:
(3) phone number:
(4) Age:

Best Regards!
Mrs. Elizabeth Edwards
