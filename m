Thanks for the references. I wasn't aware there was work in this area,
this opens up some possibilities on how to approach this.

Yes, we end up fragmenting in cases where a guest converts a sub-page to a
shared page because the fallocate(PUNCH_HOLE) gets forwarded through to shmem
which will then split it. At that point the subpage might get used elsewhere
so we no longer have the ability to restore as 2M after
invalidation/shutdown. We could potentially just intercept those
fallocate()'s and only issue the invalidation once all the subpages have
been PUNCH_HOLE'd. We'd still need to ensure KVM MMU invalidations
happen immediately though, but since we rely on a KVM ioctl to do the
conversion in advance, we can rely on the KVM MMU invalidation that
happens at that point and simply make fallocate(PUNCH_HOLE) fail if
someone attempts it on a page that hasn't been converted to shared yet.

Otherwise we could end up being an good chunk of pages depending on how
guest allocates shared pages, but I'm slightly less concerned about that
seeing as there are some general solutions to directmap fragmentation
being considered. I need to think more how this hooks would tie in to
that though.

And since we'd only really being able to avoid unrecoverable splits if
the restrictedmem is hugepage-backed (if we get a bunch of 4K pages
to begin with there's no handling that would avoid fragmentation), it seems
like we'd end up relying on hugetlbfs support for instances where a host
really wants to avoid splitting, and maybe in the case of hugetlbfs
fallocate(PUNCH_HOLE) is already a no-op of sorts? Either way maybe it's
better to explore this aspect in the context of hugetlbfs support.

Any migrations would need to be coordinated with SNP firmware at least. I
think it's possible, but that support is probably a ways out. Near-term
I think it might be more straightforward to say: if you don't want to
directmap fragmentation (for SNP anyway), you need to ensure restricted
ranges are backed by THPs or hugetlbfs, and make that the basis for
avoiding directmap splitting for now. Otherwise, it's simply done as a
best-effort, and then maybe over time, with things like [1] and migration
support in place, this restriction can go away, or become less impactful
at least.

Thanks,

Mike
