Yes, I am not saying it is an unfair comparision. It is just not a
particularly practical one for real life situations. So I am not sure
you can draw many conclusions from that. Or let me put it differently.
There is not real point comparing the code tagging and stack unwiding
approaches because the later is simply more complex because it collects
more state. The main question is whether that additional state
collection is too expensive to be practically used.

This is clear but it doesn't really tell whether the existing tooling is
unusable for _your_ or any specific scenarios. Because when we are
talking about adding quite a lot of code and make our allocators APIs
more complicated to track the state then we should carefully weigh the
benefit and the cost. As replied to other email I am really skeptical
this patchset is at the final stage and the more allocators get covered
the more code we have to maintain. So there must be a very strong reason
to add it.

I do not really think this is all that interesting because the major
memory overhead contributors (page_ext and objcg are going to be there
with other approaches that want to match alloc and free as that clearly
requires to store the allocator objects somewhere).

yes, in the current implementation you are missing most indirect users
of the page allocator as stated elsewhere so the usefulness can be
really limited. A better coverege will not increase the memory
consumption much but it will add an additional maintenance burden that
will scale with different usecases.
