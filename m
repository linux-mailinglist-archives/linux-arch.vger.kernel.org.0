Not always. If the intent is to catch a memory leak that gets worse over
time, early boot should be sufficient. Sure, there might be drivers that leak
memory allocated at init but if it's not a growing leak, it doesn't matter.

As pointed out elsewhere, attaching to the tracepoint and recording relevant
state is an option other than trying to parse a raw ftrace feed. For memory
leaks, there are already tracepoints for page allocation and free that could
be used to track allocations that are not freed at a given point in time.
There is also the kernel memory leak detector although I never had reason
to use it (https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v6.0-rc3/dev-tools/kmemleak.html)
and it sounds like it would be expensive.

Sure, there is value but nothing stops the tracepoints being attached as
a boot-time service where interested. For latencies, there is already
bpf examples for tracing individual function latency over time e.g.
https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/tools/funclatency.py although
I haven't used it recently.

Live parsing of ftrace is possible, albeit expensive.
https://github.com/gormanm/mmtests/blob/master/monitors/watch-highorder.pl
tracks counts of high-order allocations and dumps a report on interrupt as
an example of live parsing ftrace and only recording interesting state. It's
not tracking state you are interested in but it demonstrates it is possible
to rely on ftrace alone and monitor from userspace. It's bit-rotted but
can be fixed with

It's not tracking leaks because that is not what I was intrested in at
the time but could using the same method and recording PFNs that were
allocated, their call site but not freed. These days, this approach may
be a bit unexpected but it was originally written 13 years ago. It could
have been done with systemtap back then but my recollection was that it
was difficult to keep systemtap working with rc kernels.

The ease of use is a criticism as there is effort required to develop
the state tracking of in-kernel event be it from live parsing ftrace,
attaching to tracepoints with systemtap/bpf/whatever and the like. The
main disadvantage with an in-kernel implementation is three-fold. First,
it doesn't work with older kernels without backports. Second, if something
slightly different it needed then it's a kernel rebuild.  Third, if the
option is not enabled in the deployed kernel config then you are relying
on the end user being willing to deploy a custom kernel.  The initial
investment in doing memory leak tracking or latency tracking by attaching
to tracepoints is significant but it works with older kernels up to a point
and is less sensitive to the kernel config options selected as features
like ftrace are often selected.
