We are.  This is the part of the review process where we explore other
solutions to the problem.

Actually, reparents an existing VMA, and reuses the existing page tables.

Either this is a one-off kind of thing, in which case it doesn't need
ongoing maintenance, or it's something with broad applicability, in
which case it can live as its own userspace project.  It could even
start off life as part of qemu and then fork into its own project.
The idea of tagging an ELF executable to say "I can cope with having
chunks of my address space provided to me by my executor" is ... odd.
