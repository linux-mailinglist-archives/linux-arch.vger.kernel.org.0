It seems that there is now a new contributor on the irqchip front, and
the current approach *should* be better than the "copy MIPS and run"
approach that was previously taken. I'm still to find time to review
the new series (I just came back from a week off), but hopefully next
week.

I'd tend to agree. But if on the other hand the userspace ABI is
clearly defined, I think it could make sense to go for it (if I
remember well, we merged arm64 without any support irqchip support,
and the arm64 GIC support appeared later in the game).

Thanks,
