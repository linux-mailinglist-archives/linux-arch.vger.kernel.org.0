Figuring out the _correct_ place to measure is often a significant amount of the
total effort.

Having done so once, why not annotate that in the source code?

So this looks like it's gotten better since I last looked, but it's still not
there yet.

Part of the problem is that the tracepoints themselves are in the wrong place:
your end event is when a task is woken up, but that means spurious wakeups will
cause one wait_event() call to be reported as multiple smaller waits, not one
long wait - oops, now I can't actually find the thing that's causing my
multi-second delay.

Also, in your example you don't have it broken out by callsite. That would be
the first thing I'd need for any real world debugging.

So, it looks like tracing has made some progress over the past 10 years, but
for debugging latency issues it's still not there yet in general. I will
definitely remember function latency tracing the next time I'm doing performance
work, but I expect that to be far too heavy to enable on a live server.

This thing is only a couple hundred lines of code though, so perhaps tracing
shouldn't be the only tool in our toolbox :)
