Wow.  I totally missed that I'd transposed those two lines.  I read
it back with the lines in the order that they should have been in.
Every time I read it.  I was wondering why you were talking about a data
dependency, and I just couldn't see it.  With the lines in the order that
they're actually in, it's quite obvious and totally not what I meant.
Of course, it doesn't matter which order they're in from the point of
view of testing the waiters bit since we don't change the waiters bit.

I'll admit to spending far more time on the m68k version of this than
the alpha version ;-)
