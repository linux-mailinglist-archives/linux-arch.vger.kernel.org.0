While I agree that it isn't a necessity, I don't fully agree that it
isn't useful.

One of the issues will be that while Arm64 will support hotplug vCPU,
it won't be setting ACPI_HOTPLUG_CPU because it doesn't support
the present bit changing. So I can see why James decided to rename
it - because with Arm64's hotplug vCPU, the idea that ACPI_HOTPLUG_CPU
somehow enables hotplug CPU support is now no longer true.

Keeping it as ACPI_HOTPLUG_CPU makes the code less obvious, because it
leads one to assume that it ought to be enabled for Arm64's
implementatinon, and that could well cause issues in the future if
people make the assumption that "ACPI_HOTPLUG_CPU" means hotplug CPU
is supported in ACPI. It doesn't anymore.
