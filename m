Sorry, didn't have much time to do a proper review. Couple of points
here at least.

I think we should actively avoid using proc interface. The most
reasonable way would be to add get_mempolicy2 interface that would allow
extensions and then create a pidfd counterpart to allow acting on a
remote task. The latter would require some changes to make mempolicy
code less current oriented.
