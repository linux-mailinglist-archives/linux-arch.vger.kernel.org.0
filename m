Yes, pretty much, with some additional hooks to trigger migration. The
CMA mechanism was a great source of inspiration.

In addition, there are some races that are addressed mostly around page
migration/copying: the source page is untagged, the destination
allocated as untagged but before the copy an mprotect() makes the source
tagged (PG_mte_tagged set) and the copy_highpage() mechanism not having
anywhere to store the tags.

A potential issue is that devices (mobile phones) may need a different
CMA range as well for DMA (and not necessarily in ZONE_DMA). Can
free_area[MIGRATE_CMA] handle multiple disjoint ranges? I don't see why
not as it's just a list.

We (Google and Arm) went through a few rounds of discussions and
prototyping trying to find the best approach: (1) a separate free_area[]
array in each zone (early proof of concept from Peter C and Evgenii S,
https://github.com/google/sanitizers/tree/master/mte-dynamic-carveout),
(2) a new ZONE_METADATA, (3) a separate CPU-less NUMA node just for the
tag storage, (4) a new MIGRATE_METADATA type.

We settled on the latter as it closely resembles CMA without interfering
with it. I don't remember why we did not just go for MIGRATE_CMA, it may
have been the heterogeneous memory aspect and the fact that we don't
want PROT_MTE (VM_MTE) allocations from this range. If the hardware
allowed this, I think the patches would have been a bit simpler.

Alex can comment more next week on how we ended up with this choice but
if we find a way to avoid VM_MTE allocations from certain areas, I think
we can reuse the CMA infrastructure. A bigger hammer would be no VM_MTE
allocations from any CMA range but it seems too restrictive.

We had this on the table as well but the most likely deployment, at
least initially, is only some secure services enabling MTE with various
apps gradually moving towards this in time. So that's why the main
pushback from vendors is having this 3% reserved permanently. Even if
all apps use MTE, only the anonymous mappings are PROT_MTE, so still not
fully using the tag storage.
