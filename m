I'm wary of Loongson official statements like this but let's see... 
meanwhile the commit message and/or comments could be improved 
nevertheless, to provide more background.

Also I've just noticed the patch title sounds unnatural too. "Fix 
probing of the CRC32 feature" or dropping "the" from the current wording 
sounds better IMO.

IMO they don't have to. You could split into two commits so the mass 
reordering could happen separately, making each change nicely focused.
