This is useful information. However, I was specifically interested in
the impact of having the new flags field present as part of __ksymtab
(kernel_symbol), compared to keeping it in a separate section. Sorry for
not being clear.

I ran a small test to get a better understanding of the different sizes.
I used v6.17-rc6 together with the openSUSE x86_64 config [1], which is
fairly large. The resulting vmlinux.bin (no debuginfo) had an on-disk
size of 58 MiB, and included 5937 + 6589 (GPL-only) exported symbols.

The following table summarizes my measurements and calculations
regarding the sizes of all sections related to exported symbols:

                      |  HAVE_ARCH_PREL32_RELOCATIONS  | !HAVE_ARCH_PREL32_RELOCATIONS
 Section              | Base [B] | Ext. [B] | Sep. [B] | Base [B] | Ext. [B] | Sep. [B]

 __kflagstab          |       NA |       NA |    12526 |       NA |       NA |    12526
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Total                |   454044 |   504148 |   466570 |   604356 |   704564 |   616882
 Increase to base [%] |       NA |     11.0 |      2.8 |       NA |     16.6 |      2.1

The column "HAVE_ARCH_PREL32_RELOCATIONS -> Base" contains the numbers
that I measured. The rest of the values are calculated. The "Ext."
column represents the variant of extending __ksymtab, and the "Sep."
column represents the variant of having a separate __kflagstab. With
HAVE_ARCH_PREL32_RELOCATIONS, each kernel_symbol is 12 B in size and is
extended to 16 B. With !HAVE_ARCH_PREL32_RELOCATIONS, it is 24 B,
extended to 32 B. Note that this does not include the metadata needed to
relocate __ksymtab*, which is freed after the initial processing.

The base export data in this case totals 0.43 MiB. About 50% is used for
storing the names of exported symbols.

Adding __kflagstab as a separate section has a negligible impact, as
expected. When extending __ksymtab (kernel_symbol) instead, the worst
case with !HAVE_ARCH_PREL32_RELOCATIONS increases the export data size
by 16.6%.

Based on the above, I think introducing __kflagstab makes senses, as the
added complexity is minimal, although I feel we could probably also get
away with extending kernel_symbol.

This seems to answer why the in-tree flag is not sufficient for you.
However, I also suggested an alternative that the symbol protection
could be determined by whether the module is signed by a key from the
.builtin_trusted_keys keyring, as opposed to being signed by another key
reachable from the .secondary_trusted_keys keyring or being completely
unsigned.

Distributions can require that external modules be signed and allow
additional keys to be added as Machine Owner Keys, which can be made
reachable from .secondary_trusted_keys. Nonetheless, such distributions
might be still interested in limiting the number of symbols that such
external modules can use.

I think this option is worth considering, as it could potentially make
this symbol protection useful for other distributions as well.

I'm personally ok with adding the kflagstab support. I think it
introduces minimal complexity and, as you point out, simplifies certain
aspects. Additionally, if we add it, I believe that adding the proposed
symbol protection is simple enough to be included as well, at least from
my perspective.
