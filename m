Thanks for pointing this out. It certainly does look wrong to me for
the m68k nommu case. I am not aware of any existing issues caused by
this - but there is no good reason not to fix it.

So I propose this change. Build and run tested on my m68knommu targets.

Regards
Greg

Subject: [PATCH] m68knommu: set ZERO_PAGE() allocated zeroed page

The non-MMU m68k pagetable ZERO_PAGE() macro is being set to the
somewhat non-sensical value of "virt_to_page(0)". The zeroth page
is not in any way guaranteed to be a page full of "0". So the result
is that ZERO_PAGE() will almost certainly contain random values.

We already allocate a real "empty_zero_page" in the mm setup code shared
between MMU m68k and non-MMU m68k. It is just not hooked up to the
ZERO_PAGE() macro for the non-MMU m68k case.

Fix ZERO_PAGE() to use the allocated "empty_zero_page" pointer.

I am not aware of any specific issues caused by the old code.
