No they don't get patched ever. The name is a bit misleading I guess.

For a case like this it's entirely safe to just skip the code early in
boot, so if it was a static_key_false everything would just work.

Unfortunately the way the code is currently written we would have to
change all MMU features to static_key_false and that risks breaking
something else.

We have a long standing TODO to rework all our feature logic and unify
CPU/MMU/firmware/etc. features. Possibly as part of that we can come up
with a scheme where the default value is per-feature bit.

Having said all that, in this case the overhead of the test and branch
is small compared to the cost of writing to the SPR which controls user
access and then doing an isync, so it's all somewhat premature
optimisation.

cheers
