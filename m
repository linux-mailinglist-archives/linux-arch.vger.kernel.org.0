Enable qspinlock and meet the requirements mentioned in a8ad07e5240c9
("asm-generic: qspinlock: Indicate the use of mixed-size atomics").

RISC-V LR/SC pairs could provide a strong/weak forward guarantee that
depends on micro-architecture. And RISC-V ISA spec has given out
several limitations to let hardware support strict forward guarantee
(RISC-V User ISA - 8.3 Eventual Success of Store-Conditional
Instructions):
We restricted the length of LR/SC loops to fit within 64 contiguous
instruction bytes in the base ISA to avoid undue restrictions on
instruction cache and TLB size and associativity. Similarly, we
disallowed other loads and stores within the loops to avoid restrictions
on data-cache associativity in simple implementations that track the
reservation within a private cache. The restrictions on branches and
jumps limit the time that can be spent in the sequence. Floating-point
operations and integer multiply/divide were disallowed to simplify the
operating systemâ€™s emulation of these instructions on implementations
lacking appropriate hardware support.
Software is not forbidden from using unconstrained LR/SC sequences, but
portable software must detect the case that the sequence repeatedly
fails, then fall back to an alternate code sequence that does not rely
on an unconstrained LR/SC sequence. Implementations are permitted to
unconditionally fail any unconstrained LR/SC sequence.

eg:
Some riscv hardware such as BOOMv3 & XiangShan could provide strict &
strong forward guarantee (The cache line would be kept in an exclusive
state for Backoff cycles, and only this core's interrupt could break
the LR/SC pair).
Qemu riscv give a weak forward guarantee by wrong implementation
currently [1].

Add combo spinlock (ticket & queued) support
Some architecture has a flexible requirement on the type of spinlock.
Some LL/SC architectures of ISA don't force micro-arch to give a strong
forward guarantee. Thus different kinds of memory model micro-arch would
come out in one ISA. The ticket lock is suitable for exclusive monitor
designed LL/SC micro-arch with limited cores and "!NUMA". The
queue-spinlock could deal with NUMA/large-scale scenarios with a strong
forward guarantee designed LL/SC micro-arch.

The first version of patch was made in 2019.1 [2].
