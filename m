This brings us back to the interrupt controller as noted by Richard earlier.

UML devices are heavily dependent on the file io as an IRQ trigger 
paradigm and they need an interrupt controller which has an IO event 
feed into it. I did not see that in LKL on first read.

So as a first step we should get it to work with existing UML IRQ 
controller and whatever incremental patches are needed on top of that.
