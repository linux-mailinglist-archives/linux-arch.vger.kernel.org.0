One way to think of it is "release" as in "release a lock".

But to answer your question:

1.	The rest of the industry settled on "release" for that form
	of atomics a very long time ago.  Yes, we could insist on
	Linux-kernel exceptionalism, but that doesn't seem consistent
	with the large number of people coming into the kernel, even if
	only briefly.

2.	If we were to say "unlock" instead of "release", consistency
	would demand that we also say "lock" instead of "acquire".
	But "lock" is subtlely different than "acquire", and there is
	a history of people requesting further divergence.

3.	At least one architecture has started using GCC intrinsics
	to implement atomics.  I would expect more to follow.  And
	the GCC intrinsics say "_release".

4.	More cynically (and I do not bleach my hair, so yes, I do have the
	hair color for it), the Linux kernel community is sufficiently
	creative in its (ab)use of whatever tools happen to be lying
	around that any name will become misleading over time in any case.
