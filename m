Uhm, yes. Linux contributor effort is a scarce resource, and spending
it on architectures that nobody actually uses, such as alpha or ia64,
means it is not spent on things that are useful to more people.

I really do sympathize with the enthusiast/hobbyist PoV - I am also an
engineer that likes to tinker. So 'use' can be defined liberally here,
and cover running the latest Linux on ancient hardware just for
entertainment.

However, the question is not how you or I choose to spend (or waste)
their time. The question is whether it is reasonable *as a community*
to insist that everyone who contributes a cross-architecture change
also has to ensure that obsolete architectures such as i64 or alpha
are not left behind.

The original thread is an interesting example here - removing a
cpu_relax() in cmpxchg() that was only there because of IA64's clunky
SMT implementation. Perhaps this means that IA64 performance is going
to regress substantially for some workloads? Should anyone care?
Should we test such changes first? And how should we do that if there
is no maintainer and nobody has access to the hardware?

The other example is EFI, which i maintain. Should I require from
contributors that they build and boot test EFI changes on ia64 if I
myself don't even have access to the hardware? It is good to know that
things don't seem to be broken today, but if it is going to fall over,
it may take a while before anybody notices. What happens then?

I would argue that we should mark it obsolete at the very least, so
that it is crystal clear that regressing IA64 (either knowingly or
unknowingly) by a generic or cross-architecture change is not a
showstopper, even at build time. Then, if someone has the skill set
and the time on their hands, as well as access to actual hardware,
they can keep it alive if they want to.
