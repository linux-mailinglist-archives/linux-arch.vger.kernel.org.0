So this means that the interpreter will have to mprotect(PROT_BTI) the
text section of the primary executable. For subsequent libraries, it
calls mmap() explicitly anyway but not for the main executable (IIUC).

That's a valid point. If we have an old dynamic linker and the kernel
enabled BTI automatically for the main executable, could things go wrong
(e.g. does the PLT need to be BTI-aware)?
