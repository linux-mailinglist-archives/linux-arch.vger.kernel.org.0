I question whether this is the right approach.  I understand that
different hardware implementations have different requirements here,
but at least one that I'm aware of (AMD Zen 2/3) requires that all
PTEs that are part of a contig PTE must have identical A/D bits.  Now,
you could say that's irrelevant because it's x86 and we don't currently
support contPTE on x86, but I wouldn't be surprised to see that other
hardware has the same requirement.

So what if we make that a Linux requirement?  Setting a contPTE dirty or
accessed becomes a bit more expensive (although still one/two cachelines,
so not really much more expensive than a single write).  Then there's no
need to change the "get" side of things because they're always identical.

It does mean that we can't take advantage of hardware setting A/D bits,
unless hardware can be persuaded to behave this way.  I don't have any
ARM specs in front of me to check.

I don't have a hard objection to your approach, I just want to discuss
other possibilities.
