Actually you made a good point here, that I failed to check for myself 
earlier.

Looking at the arm64 and riscv image header code more closely, it seems 
loongarch is trying to follow the now deprecated riscv-specific practice 
of using 8-byte magic (deprecated as of commit 474efecb65dce ("riscv: 
modify the Image header to improve compatibility with the ARM64 
header")). In doing this they also changed the offset of the magic: on 
riscv it's at 0x30, while here it's at 0x28 (riscv's "res2" field). This 
is just the exact kind of "proliferation of image header formats" that 
we would want to avoid.

Now for some additional but important bikeshedding...

The current arm64 and riscv magic numbers are all 4-byte long, at offset 
0x38, and they are cute little strings identifying their origin: 
"ARM\x64" and "RSC\x05" respectively. Thus, for loongarch, we probably 
want to do the same -- 4-byte nice little strings with a hint of 
LoongArch/Loong. Considering UTF-8 uses 3 bytes for most Chinese 
characters, and 4 bytes for characters outside of BMP, we could use a 
little bit of creativity here:

- "LA64", the "dullest" version with only ASCII characters, but I don't 
know if future LA32 systems will want to use the same image header format;
- "\xe9\xbe\x99\x64" ("Èæô\x64") or "\xe9\xbe\x8d\x64" ("Èæç\x64") -- Èæô/Èæç 
means "loong/dragon", hence a variant of the above;
- "\xf0\x9f\x90\xb2" ("üê≤") or "\xf0\x9f\x90\x89" ("üêâ") -- the 
loong/dragon emoji, taking full advantage of the 4 bytes available while 
not mentioning bitness.

A case might be made for pure-ASCII magic numbers, that they're easier 
for naked-eye inspection, but (1) this is already not the case for the 
new riscv magic, and (2) given all other interesting fields are in 
binary it's already necessary to use hex editors for any task more 
complex than mere identification.

So, I think the bottom line is: don't use the 8-byte magic at offset 
0x28, switch to 4-byte magic at offset 0x38 to keep consistent with 
everyone else. I don't actually have a preference, but personally I'd 
prefer some freshness in the low-level land, if that doesn't hamper 
people's flows. ;-)
