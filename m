See the response from Jens for an explanation of how this works in
io_uring.

I think there's value in the orthogonality, and -1 can never be a valid
file descriptor. If this becomes a sticking point, it could certainly be
changed (just modify pipe2 to remove the O_SPECIFIC_FD flag if passed
-1), but at the same time, I'd rather have this logic implemented once
with a uniform semantic no matter what syscall uses it.

Good point. Done in v5.

Done in v5.
