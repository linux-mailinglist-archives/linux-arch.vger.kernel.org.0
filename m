Greetings,

I am the investment sourcing manager to an international business/project financier based in Bahrain.  We have huge funds available for immediate investment on any Viable Start Up or Existing business/project that requires funding.

Currently we are sourcing for opportunities for our review and consideration and would be delighted to discuss further.

Please feel free to contact us.

Regards,

Shaffiq Ayaz
