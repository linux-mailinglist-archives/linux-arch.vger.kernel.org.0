While I too am fine either way, I don't think these are as strongly 
grouped as you seem to imply. There's no big advantage in having as much 
as possible within the same file. If somebody is looking for the meaning 
of these, these headers are no match when compared e.g. with stty manpage.

For c_iflag, the break, parity and cr related "groups" within c_iflag are 
moving completely to common header.

IXANY is probably only one close to borderline whether it kind of belongs 
to the same group as IXON/IXOFF (which both by chance both remained on the 
same side in the split). I don't think it does strongly enough to warrant 
keeping them next to each other but I'm open what opinions others have on 
it.

The rest in c_iflag don't seem to be strongly tied/grouped to the other 
defines within c_iflag. They're just bits that appear next/close to each 
other but are not tied by any significant meaning-based connection.

C_oflag is more messy. I exercised grouping based judgement with c_oflag 
where only the defines with all bits as zero would have moved to the 
common header breaking the groups very badly. That is, only CR0 would have 
moved and CR1-3 remained in arch headers, etc. which made no sense to do. 
One could argue, that since ONLCR (and perhaps CRDLY) are not moving, no 
other cr related defines should move either.

Yes, lets wait and see what the others think.

Thanks for taking a look!
