Right, your understanding is correct. I think Sean had only mentioned in
passing that it was something we could potentially do, and in the cases I
was looking at it ended up being useful. I only mentioned it so I don't
seem like I'm too far out in the weeds here :)

For SNP it's been discussed for quite some time, and either splitting or
removing private entries from directmap are the well-discussed way I'm
aware of to avoid RMP violations due to some other kernel process using
a 2MB mapping to access shared memory if there are private pages that
happen to be within that range.

In both cases the issue of how to restore directmap as 2M becomes a
problem.

I was also under the impression TDX had similar requirements. If so,
do you know what the plan is for handling this for TDX?

There are also 2 potential alternatives I'm aware of, but these haven't
been discussed in much detail AFAIK:

a) Ensure confidential guests are backed by 2MB pages. shmem has a way to
   request 2MB THP pages, but I'm not sure how reliably we can guarantee
   that enough THPs are available, so if we went that route we'd probably
   be better off requiring the use of hugetlbfs as the backing store. But
   obviously that's a bit limiting and it would be nice to have the option
   of using normal pages as well. One nice thing with invalidation
   scheme proposed here is that this would "Just Work" if implement
   hugetlbfs support, so an admin that doesn't want any directmap
   splitting has this option available, otherwise it's done as a
   best-effort.

b) Implement general support for restoring directmap as 2M even when
   subpages might be in use by other kernel threads. This would be the
   most flexible approach since it requires no special handling during
   invalidations, but I think it's only possible if all the CPA
   attributes for the 2M range are the same at the time the mapping is
   restored/unsplit, so some potential locking issues there and still
   chance for splitting directmap over time.

Right, I forgot to add that in my proposed changes I added invalidations
for any still-allocated private pages present when the restricted memfd
notifier is unregistered. This was needed to avoid leaking pages back to
the kernel that still need directmap or RMP table fixups. I also added
similar invalidations for memfd->release(), since it seems possible that
userspace might close() it before shutting down guest, but maybe the
latter is not needed if KVM takes a reference on the FD during life of
the guest.

That's true, it only reduces invalidations if we decide to provide a
struct page/folio as part of the invalidation callbacks, which isn't
the case yet. Sorry for the confusion.

In theory userspace should not be allocating/hole-punching restricted
pages for GPA ranges that are already mapped as private in the xarray,
and KVM could potentially fail such requests (though it does currently).

But if we somehow enforced that, then we could rely on
KVM_MEMORY_ENCRYPT_REG_REGION to handle all the MMU invalidation stuff,
which would free up the restricted fd invalidation callbacks to be used
purely to handle doing things like RMP/directmap fixups prior to returning
restricted pages back to the host. So that was sort of my thinking why the
new semantics would still cover all the necessary cases.
