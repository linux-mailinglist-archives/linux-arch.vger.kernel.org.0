It's up to the recipient whether they try to map it at the same address
or at a fresh address.  The intended use case is a "semi-shared" address
space between two processes (ie partway between a threaded, fully-shared
address space and a forked un-shared address space), in which case
there's a certain amount of trust and cooperation between the processes.

Your preservation-across-exec use-case might or might not need the
VMA to be mapped at the same address.  I don't know whether qemu stores
pointers in this VMA which are absolute within the qemu address space.
If it's just the emulated process's address space, then everything will
be absolute within its own address space and everything will be opaque
to qemu.  If qemu is storing its own pointers in it, then it has to be
mapped at the same address.

It's a net increase of 200 lines of kernel code.  If 4 lines of userspace
code removes 200 lines of kernel code, I think I know which I prefer ...
