Yes?  The alignment check isn't strictly required, KVM _could_ deal with the above
scenario, it's just a lot simpler and safer for KVM if the file offset needs to
be sanely aligned.

Hmm, I was thinking this would be a non-issue because the check would be tied to
the max page _possible_ page size irrespective of hardware support, but that would
be problematic if KVM ever supports 512GiB pages.  I'm not sure that speculatively
requiring super huge memslots to be 512GiB aligned is sensible.

Aha!  If we go with a KVM ioctl(), a clean way around this is tie the alignment
requirement to the memfd flags, e.g. if userspace requests the memfd to be backed
by PMD hugepages, then the memslot offset needs to be 2MiB aligned on x86.  That
will continue to work if (big if) KVM supports 512GiB pages because the "legacy"
memfd would still be capped at 2MiB pages.

Architectures that support variable hugepage sizes might need to do something
else, but I don't think that possibility affects what x86 can/can't do.

No, KVM already gracefully handles situations like this.  Well, x86 does, I assume
other architectures do too :-)

As above, the intent of the extra restriction is so that KVM doen't need even more
weird code (read: math) to gracefully handle the new edge cases that would come with
fd-only memslots.
