A big ad on a banner. But more seriously.

This patchset is _huge_ and touching a lot of different areas. It will
be not only hard to review but even harder to maintain longterm. So
it is completely reasonable to ask for potential alternatives with a
smaller code footprint. I am pretty sure you are aware of that workflow.

So I find Peter's question completely appropriate while your response to
that not so much! Maybe ftrace is not the right tool for the intented
job. Maybe there are other ways and it would be really great to show
that those have been evaluated and they are not suitable for a), b) and
c) reasons.

E.g. Oscar has been working on extending page_ext to track number of
allocations for specific calltrace[1]. Is this 1:1 replacement? No! But
it can help in environments where page_ext can be enabled and it is
completely non-intrusive to the MM code.

If the page_ext overhead is not desirable/acceptable then I am sure
there are other options. E.g. kprobes/LivePatching framework can hook
into functions and alter their behavior. So why not use that for data
collection? Has this been evaluated at all?

And please note that I am not claiming the presented work is approaching
the problem from a wrong direction. It might very well solve multiple
problems in a single go _but_ the long term code maintenance burden
really has to to be carefully evaluated and if we can achieve a
reasonable subset of the functionality with an existing infrastructure
then I would be inclined to sacrifice some portions with a considerably
smaller code footprint.
