Yes, agree. However I think the performence influence of this patch is 
small from some testing I did (like mysql, no obvious performance 
influence). Moreover the pagetable accounting gap is about 1% from below 
testing data.

Without this patchset, the pagetable consumption is about 110M with 
mysql testing.

With this patchset, and the consumption is about 111M.

However these statistics are arch-specific information, which only 
available on x86, s390 and powerpc.

Thanks for your input.
