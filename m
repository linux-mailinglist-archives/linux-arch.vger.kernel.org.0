I think I've explained this somewhere else a couple of months ago but
just in case you weren't on that thread or don't remember and apologies
if you should already know.

A lot of filesystem will happily update the mode of a symlink. The VFS
doesn't do anything to prevent this from happening. This is filesystem
specific.

The EOPNOTSUPP you're seeing very likely comes from POSIX ACLs.
Specifically it comes from filesystems that call posix_acl_chmod(),
e.g., btrfs via

        if (!err && attr->ia_valid & ATTR_MODE)
                err = posix_acl_chmod(idmap, dentry, inode->i_mode);

Most filesystems don't implement i_op->set_acl() for POSIX ACLs.
So posix_acl_chmod() will report EOPNOTSUPP. By the time
posix_acl_chmod() is called, most filesystems will have finished
updating the inode. POSIX ACLs also often aren't integrated into
transactions so a rollback wouldn't even be possible on some
filesystems.

Any filesystem that doesn't implement POSIX ACLs at all will obviously
never fail unless it blocks mode changes on symlinks. Or filesystems
that do have a way to rollback failures from posix_acl_chmod(), or
filesystems that do return an error on chmod() on symlinks such as 9p,
ntfs, ocfs2.

Hm, blocking symlink mode changes is pretty regression prone. And just
blocking it through one interface seems weird and makes things even more
inconsistent.

So two options I see:
(1) minimally invasive:
    Filesystems that do call posix_acl_chmod() on symlinks need to be
    changed to stop doing that.
(2) might hit us on the head invasive:
    Try and block symlink mode changes in chmod_common().

Thoughts?
