I think you missed the point, Gary's suggestion at that time sounds
like: let's impl Atomic<i32> and Atomic<i64> first, and leave rest of
the work for later, that is a "do the design later" to me.

Mine is simple, just providing AtomicI32 and AtomicI64 first, since
there are immediate users right now, and should we learn more needs from
the users, we get more idea about what a good API is, and we evolve from
there.

You mean you said it's a non-issue but gave me two counteract? If it's
really a non-issue, you won't need a couneraction, right? In other words
non-generic atomics do provide some value.

I will just start with the existing mechanism and try to evolve, whether
it's a script or proc macro, I don't mind, I want to get the work done
and most relevant people can understand in the way the they prefer and
step-by-step, move it to the place I think is the best for the project.

I already mentioned why I think it's good in the current way, I will

Sure. Look like my memory is correct, at least on ARM64 they are
different instructions (see arch/arm64/include/asm/atomic_lse.h)

non-return atomics on ARM64:

	#define ATOMIC_OP(op, asm_op)						\
	static __always_inline void						\
	__lse_atomic_##op(int i, atomic_t *v)					\
	{									\
		asm volatile(							\
		__LSE_PREAMBLE							\
		"	" #asm_op "	%w[i], %[v]\n"				\
		: [v] "+Q" (v->counter)						\
		: [i] "r" (i));							\
	}

value-return atomics on ARM64:

	#define ATOMIC_FETCH_OP(name, mb, op, asm_op, cl...)			\
	static __always_inline int						\
	__lse_atomic_fetch_##op##name(int i, atomic_t *v)			\
	{									\
		int old;							\
										\
		asm volatile(							\
		__LSE_PREAMBLE							\
		"	" #asm_op #mb "	%w[i], %w[old], %[v]"			\
		: [v] "+Q" (v->counter),					\
		  [old] "=r" (old)						\
		: [i] "r" (i)							\
		: cl);								\
										\
		return old;							\
	}

It may not be easy to see the different instructions from the pasted
code, but you can find them in the header file, also you could notice
that the number of operands is different?

Hmm.. so we ask user to write arch-specific code like:

	pub fn increase_counter(&self) {
	    #[cfg(CONFIG_ARM64)]
	    self.counter.inc();

	    #[cfg(CONFIG_X86_64)]
	    let _ = self.counter.inc_return();
	}

are you sure it's a good idea?
