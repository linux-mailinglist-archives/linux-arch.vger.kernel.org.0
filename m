And yet a smart guy named Eric said:
  "There is just enough complexity in exec currently that our implementation of exec is 
  already teetering."
which suggests that a user-space re-implementation will also be complex.
In complexity lies bugs.

In the normal use case the addresses of the preserved anon segments were
already randomized during allocation in the pre-exec process.  Preservation
across exec does not make the process less safe from an external attack.

Now, if the attacker injects content at known addresses by preserving and
exec'ing, then the post-exec process must decide whether to trust the
pre-exec process.  Let's prevent preservation when exec'ing setuid binaries.
That is not part of this patch series, but is a good idea.  So, uid does not
change across exec.  Do I trust myself?  Yes I do.  If the uid is trusted,
as it must be in the qemu use case which accesses system resources, then
that is sufficient.  If the exec raises caps, and the uid is not trusted,
then the post-exec process must do additional work to verify the pre-exec
credentials.  The method is left to the app.  We defined the ELF opt-in so
that processes that do not use preserved memory will never receive any and
will never need to deal with such verification.

Matthews sileby/mshare proposal has the same issue.  If a process opts-in
and mmap's an address in the shared region, then content becomes mapped at
a VA that was known to the pre-fork or pre-exec process.  Trust must still
be established.

Thanks for the suggestion.  That is clever, and would make a fun project,
but I would not trust it for production.  These few lines are just
the first of many that it would take to reset the environment to the
well-defined post-exec initial conditions that all executables expect,
and incrementally tearing down state will be prone to bugs.  Getting a
clean slate from a kernel exec is a much more reliable design.  The use
case is creating long-lived apps that never go down, and the simplest
implementation will have the fewest bugs and is the best.  MADV_DOEXEC is
simple, and does not even require a new system call, and the kernel already
knows how to exec without bugs.
