It was: the previous version was a "get" and "set" interface. That
interface didn't allow for the possibility that something else in the
process had already set a minimum. This new atomic increase interface
(which also serves as a "get" interface if you pass 0) makes it possible
for a userspace library to reserve a range. (You have no guarantee about
previously allocated descriptors in that range, but you know that no
*new* automatically allocated descriptors will appear in that range,
which suffices; userspace can do the rest.)
