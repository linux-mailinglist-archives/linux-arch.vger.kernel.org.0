That's a very good point. I was starting to work on O_CREAT via
resolveat(2) and it definitely was much harder than most people would be
happy to deal with -- I'm not even sure that I handled all the cases.

I'll go for an openat2(2) then. Thinking about it some more -- since
it's a new syscall, I could actually implement the O_PATH link-mode as
being just the regular mode argument (since openat(2) ignores the mode
for non-O_CREAT anyway). The openat(2) wrapper might be more than
one-line as a result but it should avoid polluting the resolution flags
with mode flags (since openat(O_PATH) needs to have a g+rwx mode for
backwards-compatibility).

Yeah, I agree -- most folks would want to double-check what they've
opened or O_PATH'd. Though I'm still not clear what is the best way of
doing the "stat" argument is -- especially given how much fun
architecture-specific shenanigans are in fs/stat.c (should I only use
cp_new_stat64 or have a separate 64-bit syscall).

Yup, I agree. I was hoping to shunt most of the convenience to userspace
to avoid ruffling feathers in VFS-land, but I'm more than happy to make
the kernel ABI more convenient.

> The whole "this is Linux-specific" is a big inconvenience point

I hope that other OSes will take our lead and have a similar interface
so that the particular inconvenience can go away eventually (this was
one of the arguments for resolveat(2) -- it's a clear "this is a new
idea" interface rather than mixing it with other O_* flags).

Sure, this could be added -- though I'm sure folks would have
disagreements over whether it should be a resolution flag on an open
flag.

This seems like a reasonable default, except for the cases of
RESOLVE_BENEATH and RESOLVE_IN_ROOT (that would make using AT_FDCWD more
cumbersome than necessary). But other than that, I'd be happy to invert
all the other flags.
