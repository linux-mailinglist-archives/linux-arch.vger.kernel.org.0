I'll reply here and maybe cover multiple things.


User code already needs to rewind the regular stack to call sigreturn -- 
sigreturn find the signal frame based on ESP/RSP.  So if you call it 
from the wrong place, you go boom.  I think that the Linux SHSTK ABI 
should have the property that no amount of tampering with just the 
ucontext and associated structures can cause sigreturn to redirect to 
the wrong IP -- there should be something on the shadow stack that also 
gets verified in sigreturn.  IIRC the series does this, but it's been a 
while.  The post-sigreturn SSP should be entirely implied by 
pre-sigreturn SSP (or perhaps something on the shadow stack), so, in the 
absence of an altshadowstack feature, no ucontext changes should be needed.

We can also return from a signal or from more than one signal at once, 
as above, using siglongjmp.  It seems like this should Just Work (tm), 
at least in the absence of altshadowstack.

So this leaves altshadowstack.  If we want to allow userspace to handle 
a shstk overflow, I think we need altshadowstack.  And I can easily 
imagine signal handling in a coroutine or user-threading evironment (Go? 
UMCG or whatever it's called?) wanting this.  As noted, this obnoxious 
Andy person didn't like putting any shstk-related extensions in the FPU 
state.

For better or for worse, altshadowstack is (I think) fundamentally a new 
API.  No amount of ucontext magic is going to materialize an entire 
shadow stack out of nowhere when someone calls sigaltstack().  So the 
questions are: should we support altshadowstack from day one and, if so, 
what should it look like?

If we want to be clever, we could attempt to make altstadowstack 
compatible with RSTORSSP.  Signal delivery pushes a restore token to the 
old stack (hah!  what if the old stack is full?) and pushes the RSTORSSP 
busy magic to the new stack, and sigreturn inverts it.  Code that wants 
to return without sigreturn does it manually with RSTORSSP.  (Assuming 
that I've understood the arcane RSTORSSP sequence right.  Intel wins 
major points for documentation quality here.)  Or we could invent our 
own scheme.  In either case, I don't immediately see any reason that the 
ucontext needs to contain a shadow stack pointer.

There's a delightful wart to consider, though.  siglongjmp, at least as 
currently envisioned, can't return off an altshadowstack: the whole 
point of the INCSSP distance restrictions to to avoid incrementing right 
off the top of the current stack, but siglongjmp off an altshadowstack 
fundamentally switches stacks.  So either siglongjmp off an 
altshadowstack needs to be illegal or it needs to work differently.  (By 
incssp-ing to the top of the altshadowstack, then switching, then 
incssp-ing some more?  How does it even find the top of the current 
altshadowstack?)  And the plot thickens if one tries to siglongjmp off 
two nested altshadowstack-using signals in a single call.   Fortunately, 
since altshadowstack is a new API, it's not entirely crazy to have 
different rules.

So I don't have a complete or even almost complete design in mind, but I 
think we do need to make a conscious decision either to design this 
right or to skip it for v1.

As for CRIU, I don't think anyone really expects a new kernel, running 
new userspace that takes advantage of features in the new kernel, to 
work with old CRIU.  Upgrading to a SHSTK kernel should still allow 
using CRIU with non-SHSTK userspace, but I don't see how it's possible 
for CRIU to handle SHSTK without updates.  We should certainly do our 
best to make CRIU's life easy, though.
