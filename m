No, we're still waiting on the tracing people to _demonstrate_, not
claim, that this is at all possible in a comparable way with tracing. 

It's not on us to make your argument for you, and before making
accusations about honesty you should try to be more honest yourself.

The expectations you're trying to level have never been the norm in the
kernel community, sorry. When there's a technical argument about the
best way to do something, _code wins_ and we've got working code to do
something that hasn't been possible previously.

There's absolutely no rule that "tracing has to be the one and only tool
for kernel visibility".

I'm considering the tracing discussion closed until someone in the
pro-tracing camp shows something new.

Honestly, this isn't terribly relevant, because as noted before page
owner is limited to just page allocations.

Michel, the discussions with you seem to perpetually go in circles; it's
clear you're negative on the patchset, you keep raising the same
objections while refusing to concede a single point.

I believe I've answered enough, so I'll leave off further discussions
with you.
