Hi Linus, Paul,

Apologies for the slow response here; believe it or not, I was attending
a workshop about memory ordering.

Although this is true, there's a really subtle issue which crops up if you
try to compose this read-after-read ordering with dependencies in the case
where the two reads read the same value (which is encapsulated by the
unusual RSW litmus test that I've tried to convert to C below):


/* Global definitions; assume everything zero-initialised */
struct foo {
	int *x;
};

int x;
struct foo foo;
struct foo *ptr;


/* CPU 0 */
WRITE_ONCE(x, 1);
WRITE_ONCE(foo.x, &x);

/*
 * Release ordering to ensure that somebody following a non-NULL ptr will
 * see a fully-initialised 'foo'. smp_[w]mb() would work as well.
 */
smp_store_release(&ptr, &foo);


/* CPU 1 */
int *xp1, *xp2, val;
struct foo *foop;

/* Load the global pointer and check that it's not NULL. */
foop = READ_ONCE(ptr);
if (!foop)
	return;

/*
 * Load 'foo.x' via the pointer we just loaded. This is ordered after the
 * previous READ_ONCE() because of the address dependency.
 */
xp1 = READ_ONCE(foop->x);

/*
 * Load 'foo.x' directly via the global 'foo'.
 * _This is loading the same address as the previous READ_ONCE() and
 *  therefore cannot return a stale (NULL) value!_
 */
xp2 = READ_ONCE(foo.x);

/*
 * Load 'x' via the pointer we just loaded.
 * _We may see zero here!_
 */
val = READ_ONCE(*xp2);


So in this case, the two same-location reads on CPU1 are actually executed
out of order, but you can't tell just by looking at them in isolation
because they returned the same value (i.e. xp1 == xp2 == &x). However, you
*can* tell when you compose them in funny situations such as above (and I
believe that this is demonstrably true on PPC and Arm; effectively the
read-after-read ordering machinery only triggers in response to incoming
snoops).

There's probably a more-compelling variant using an (RCpc) load acquire
instead of the last address dependency on CPU 1 as well.

Anyway, I think all I'm trying to say is that I'd tend to shy away from
relying on read-after-read ordering if it forms part of a more involved
ordering relationship.

FWIW, that makes sense to me. We already have release/acquire/releaxed
variants of the bitops in the atomic_t API so it seems natural to have
a counterpart in the actual bitops API as well.
