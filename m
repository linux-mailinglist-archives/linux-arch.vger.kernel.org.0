If you bother to google "kernel log parser", you'll discover it's quite
an active area which supports a load of company business models.

It's not in sysfs, no.  As aren't a lot of things, which is why log
parsing for system monitoring is big business.

It might not be listed as stable, but when it's known there's a large
ecosystem out there consuming it we shouldn't break it just because you
feel like it.  You should have a good reason and the break should be
unavoidable.  I wanted my output in a particular form so I thought I'd
change everyone else's output as well isn't a good reason and it only
costs a couple of lines to avoid.

What fragmentation?  To do this properly you move the whole of the
current function to a helper which takes a format sting, say with a
double underscore prefix, then the existing function and what you want
become one line additions calling the helper with their specific format
string.  There's no fragmentation of the base function at all.
