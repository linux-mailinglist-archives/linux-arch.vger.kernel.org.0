We've got a whole spectrum of kernel code though, and a lot of it is
code that - honestly, we'd be better off if it wasn't specific to the
kernel.

rhashtable comes to mind; it's a fully generic, excellent at what it
does, but it's had a number of annoyingly subtle bugs and sharp edges
over the years that are really just a result of it not having enough
users.

So I see some real value in regularizing things.

I don't think mixing access sizes should be a real barrier. On the read
side we can obviously do that with a helper; the write side needs
compiler help, but "writing just a byte out of a word" is no different
from a compiler POV that "write a single bit", and we can already mix
atomic_or() with atomic_add(), with both C atomics and LKMM atomics.

Well, some of that's historical cruft; cmpxchg() and atomic_cmpxchg()
have different orderings, and we can specify that more directly now.

But we definitely need the ability to cmpxchg() any struct of a size the
machine supports atomic access to. Rust should be able to manage that
more easily than C/C++ though - they've got a type system that can
sanely represent that.
