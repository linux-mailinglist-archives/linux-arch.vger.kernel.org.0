They need access to parts of the memory. At the moment you run your
VirtIO domains in the Dom0 and give them access to the whole of a DomU's
address space - however the Xen model is by default the guests memory is
inaccessible to other domains on the system. The DomU guest uses the Xen
grant model to expose portions of its address space to other domains -
namely for the VirtIO queues themselves and any pages containing buffers
involved in the VirtIO transaction. My thought was that looks like a
guest memory interface which is mostly inaccessible (private) with some
holes in it where memory is being explicitly shared with other domains.

What I want to achieve is a common userspace API with defined semantics
for what happens when private and shared regions are accessed. Because
having each hypervisor/confidential computing architecture define its
own special API for accessing this memory is just a recipe for
fragmentation and makes sharing common VirtIO backends impossible.

Maybe my understanding is backwards then. Are you saying a guest starts
with all its memory exposed and then selectively unmaps the private
regions? Is this driven by the VMM or the guest itself?
