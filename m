Running a normal 32-bit userspace would require HW support for the 
32-bit mode switch for userspace, though (rv32 isn't a subset of rv64, 
so there's nothing we can do to make those binaries function correctly 
with uABI).  The userspace-only mode switch is a bit simpler than the 
user+supervisor switch, but it seems like vendors who really want the 
memory savings would just implement both mode switches.

At least having them as an option seems reasonable.  Historically we 
haven't gated new base systems on having every feature the others do, 
though (!MMU, rv32, etc).

We also have 32-bit kernel support.  Systems that have tens of MB of RAM 
tend to end up with some memory technology that doesn't scale to 
gigabytes these days, and since that's fixed when the chip is built it 
seems like those folks would be better off just having HW support for 
32-bit kernels (and maybe not even bothering with HW support for 64-bit 
kernels).

Thanks.  I agree we need to see some real systems that benefit from 
this, as it's a pretty big support cost.  Just defconfig sizes doesn't 
mean a whole lot, as users on these very constrained systems aren't 
likely to run defconfig anyway.

If someone's going to use it then I'm fine taking the code, it just 
seems like a very thin set of possible use cases.  We've already got 
almost no users in RISC-V land, I've got a feeling this is esoteric 
enough to actually have zero.
