Ah, yes, thats what I was referring to, the fact that the memory nodes are
parsed in setup_arch -> setup_machine_fdt -> early_init_dt_scan, and the
reserved memory is parsed later in setup_arch -> arm64_memblock_init.

If the rule is that no memblock allocations can take place between
setup_machine_fdt() and arm64_memblock_init(), then putting tag storage in
a /memory node will work, thank you for the clarification.

I don't think that works - reserved memory is parsed in setup_arch ->
arm64_memblock_init, and the cpu capabilities are initialized later, in
smp_prepare_boot_cpu.

Tag storage memory is discovered in 2 staged: first it is added to memblock
with memblock_add(), then reserved with memblock_reserve().  This is
performed in setup_arch(), after setup_machine_fdt(), and before
arm64_memblock_init(). The tag torage code keeps an array of the discovered
tag regions. This is implemented in this patch.

The next patch [1] adds an arch_initcall that checks if
memblock_end_of_DRAM() is less than the upper address of a tag storage
region. If that is the case, then tag storage memory is kept as reserved
and remains unused by the kernel.

The next check is for mte enabled: if it is disabled, then the pages are
unreserved by doing free_reserved_page().

And finally, if all the checks pass, the tag storage pages are put on the
MIGRATE_CMA lists with init_cma_reserved_pageblock().
