I am afraid there has been a misunderstanding. What do you mean by
"location doesn't matter"?

At the very least, Linux needs to know the address and size of a memory
region to use it. The series is about using the tag storage memory for
data. Tag storage cannot be described as a regular memory node because it
cannot be tagged (and normal memory can).

Then there's the matter of the tag storage block size (explained in this
commit message), and also knowing the memory range for which a tag storage
region stores the tags. This is explained in the cover letter.

Is there something that you feel that is not clear enough? I am more than
happy to go into details.

Thanks,
Alex
