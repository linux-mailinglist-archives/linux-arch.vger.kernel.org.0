Note that we're currently pondering fork + exec, and suggestions would
be appreciated. We think we'll need some restrictions, like Peter
proposed here: here:
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/YBvj6eJR%2FDY2TsEB@hirez.programming.kicks-ass.net/

We think what we want is to inherit the events to children only if
cloned with CLONE_SIGHAND. If there's space for a 'inherit_mask' in
perf_event_attr, that'd be most flexible, but perhaps we do not have
the space.

Thanks,
