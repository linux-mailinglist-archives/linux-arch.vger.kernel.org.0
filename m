Okay, I now realize that this patch set effectively duplicates some CMA 
behavior using a new migrate-type. Yeah, that's probably not what we 
want just to identify if memory is taggable or not.

Maybe there is a way to just keep reusing most of CMA instead.


Another simpler idea to get started would be to just intercept the first 
PROT_MTE, and allocate all CMA memory. In that case, systems that don't 
ever use PROT_MTE can have that additional 3% of memory.

You probably know better how frequent it is that only a handful of 
applications use PROT_MTE, such that there is still a significant 
portion of tag memory to be reused (and if it's really worth optimizing 
for that scenario).
