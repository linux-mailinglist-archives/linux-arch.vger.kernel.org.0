I have really missed this point. The behavior here is and should

be aligned with the manual definition.

I have performed the testcase on the same environment with

several old LTS kernel versions, all the results are "fault".

The behavior before and after your patches should be consistent.


So the fault should due to the disagreement between the

testcase's intention and the real pread64 definition. I have been

misled by the former one. Thanks for your interpretation.
