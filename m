Good Day,

side.Reference private investors who are seeking investments in your 
Country/Company. I had also sent you earlier their basic information for 
your consideration but yet to hear from you. Kindly confirm that you got 
my message as I await for your response

Sincere regards,
FRANK KALUNGA
