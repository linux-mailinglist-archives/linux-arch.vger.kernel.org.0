While the scheme you propose does allow verification of rebuildability,
it does not satisfy the requirements for a reproducible build as
understood by the general reproducible builds community:

	When is a build reproducible?

	A build is reproducible if given the same source code, build environment
	and build instructions, any party can recreate bit-by-bit identical
	copies of all specified artifacts.

	The relevant attributes of the build environment, the build instructions
	and the source code as well as the expected reproducible artifacts are
	defined by the authors or distributors. The artifacts of a build are the
	parts of the build results that are the desired primary output.

https://reproducible-builds.org/docs/definition/

Specifically the output of a previous build (the public key, module
signatures) is not available during the rebuild or verification.

Currently distros either don't enforce the reproducibility of the
kernel package at all or disable MODULE_SIG.
With the proposed scheme there would be no signatures on builtin modules.

The currently existing tooling does not have any nuance in its
verifications. It just compares bit-by-bit.
I think this is intentional as any bespoke per-package logic would
introduce possible failure modes and stand in the way of implementing
multiple completely independent verification toolsets.
While bespoke tools like diffoscope exist, these are only for
development and debugging. Not not for the reproducibiliy check itself.

How to handle secure-boot with distro keys is not yet clearly defined.
I see two possibilities, which should be possible with the proposed
scheme, both starting with the build of an unsigned kernel package.
Then a signature would be computed on private infrastructure and either
* shipped in a standalone package, to be combined with the kernel when
  that is installed to the ESP/flash etc.
* used as input of a signed kernel package where it is combined with the
  unsigned kernel image.
