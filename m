No. I wrote v1, and Jens incorporated some of those patches into a v2
series that added signoffs. So when I took patch 2 from that series and
rebased it into this new series, I kept the signoff.

This was intentional, and I think it makes sense to keep. I'd like to
maintain the same consistent behavior in any call that uses
O_SPECIFIC_FD: an fd of -1 means "go ahead and assign the lowest
available fd". This allows for calls like pipe2, or in the future
socketpair, where you might want to explicitly assign one end, but allow
the kernel to allocate the other end. -1 can never be a valid file
descriptor, since it would be interpreted as an errno instead. mmap
similarly treats -1 as an invalid file descriptor.

As an example use case: in one io_uring batch, you want to allocate a
pipe, send one end over a UNIX socket to another process, and close that
end in your process. So you need *that* end to be a userspace-allocated
file descriptor, so you know what fd to use in the subsequent sendmsg
and close calls. But for the other end that you plan to hold onto, you
don't want to use up one of your small number of preallocated file
descriptors (of which you only need enough for the operations in any one
io_uring batch).

However, in response to your comment below, I've changed this from -1 to
UINT_MAX.

Exactly. I documented that difference explicitly in the commit message:

I also intend for that to appear in the manpage.

Sure; I'll move it down and add a comment.

Good idea; done.

Good catch! Added.

I checked other architectures carefully, and yes, I picked this value
because some of the intermediate values conflicted on specific
architectures.

See my explanation above for why I do want to allow `-1` here.

However, there's no reason I need to make the field signed just because
of that one reserved value. I'll change the field to a __u32.
