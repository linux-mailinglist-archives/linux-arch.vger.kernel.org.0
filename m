Oh come off it, you know this stuff already ;)

That's the badger. I've no doubt that you're aware of it already, but I
thought it was a useful exercise to transcribe it to C and have it on the
mailing list for folks to look at.

Yes.

Yes, although I think it's a tiny bit more like real code to have it done
here, although it means that the "surprising" outcome relies on this being
reordered before the store to x.

Yes.

Indeed, but I was trying to make this look like C code for non-litmus
speakers!

Right, there is only po from the initial read to this read. If there was an
address dependency, then we'd have a chain of address dependencies from the
first read to the last read on this CPU and the result (of x == 0) would be
forbidden.

That's promising, but see below...

Ah wait, you need a barrier between these two writes, don't you? I used
an smp_store_release() but smp[w]_mb() should do too.
