Commit b212921b13bd ("elf: don't use MAP_FIXED_NOREPLACE for elf
executable mappings") reverted back to using MAP_FIXED to map elf load
segments because it was found that the load segments in some binaries
overlap and can cause MAP_FIXED_NOREPLACE to fail.  The original intent
of MAP_FIXED_NOREPLACE was to prevent the silent clobbering of an
existing mapping (e.g. the stack) by the elf image.  To achieve this,
expand on the logic used when loading ET_DYN binaries which calculates a
total size for the image when the first segment is mapped, maps the
entire image, and then unmaps the remainder before remaining segments
are mapped.  Apply this to ET_EXEC binaries as well as ET_DYN binaries
as is done now, and for both ET_EXEC and ET_DYN+INTERP use
MAP_FIXED_NOREPLACE for the initial total size mapping and MAP_FIXED for
remaining mappings.  For ET_DYN w/out INTERP, continue to map at a
system-selected address in the mmap region.
