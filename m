To be suitable for the qemu use case, we need a guarantee that the same VA range
is available in the new process, with nothing else mapped there.  From your spec,
it sounds like the new process could do a series of unrelated mmap's which could
overlap the desired va range before the silby mmap(fd) is performed??

Also, we need to support updating legacy processes that already created anon segments.
We inject code that calls MADV_DOEXEC for such segments.
