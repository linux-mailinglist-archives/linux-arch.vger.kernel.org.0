Yes, similar in conception. For KVM, memfd_restricted() is used by host
OS, guest will issue conversion between private and shared for its
memory range. This is similar to Xen DomU guest grants its memory to
other domains. Similarly, I guess to make memfd_restricted() being really
useful for Xen, it should be run on the VirtIO backend domain (e.g.
equivalent to the host position for KVM).

Yes, I agree. That's interesting to explore.

For confidential computing usages, normally guest starts with all guest
memory being private, e.g,  cannot be accessed by host. The memory will
be lived in memfd_restricted() memory and not exposed to host userspace
VMM like QEMU. Guest then can selectively map its private sub regions
(e.g. VirtIO queue in the guest VirtIO frontend driver) as shared so
host backend driver in QEMU can see it. When this happens, new shared
mapping will be established in KVM and the new memory will be provided
from normal mmap-able memory, then QEMU can do whatever it can do for
the device emulation.
