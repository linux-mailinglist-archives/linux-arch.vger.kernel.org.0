That could happen.  eg libc might get its text segment mapped there
randomly.  I believe Khalid was working on a solution for reserving
memory ranges.

Yes, I was assuming you'd inject code that called mshare().

Actually, since you're injecting code, why do you need the kernel to
be involved?  You can mmap the new executable and any libraries it depends
upon, set up a new stack and jump to the main() entry point, all without
calling exec().  I appreciate it'd be a fair amount of code, but it'd all
be in userspace and you can probably steal / reuse code from ld.so (I'm
not familiar with the details of how setting up an executable is done).
