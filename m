We covered this previously, I'll just be giving the same answers I did
before:

We've made this as clean and simple as posssible: a single new macro
invocation per allocation function, no calling convention changes (that
would indeed have been a lot of churn!)

Tracing people _claimed_ this, but never demonstrated it. Tracepoints
exist but the tooling that would consume them to provide this kind of
information does not exist; it would require maintaining an index of
_every outstanding allocation_ so that frees could be accounted
correctly - IOW, it would be _drastically_ higher overhead, so not at
all comparable.

Page owner is also very high overhead, and the output is not very user
friendly (tracking full call stack means many related overhead gets
split, not generally what you want), and it doesn't cover slab.

This tracks _all_ memory allocations - slab, page, vmalloc, percpu.
