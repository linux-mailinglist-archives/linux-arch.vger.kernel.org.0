It's not the same thing though :-)

UML right now doesn't have or support virtio devices in the built-in
hypervisor, what we wanted to use virtio for was explicitly for the
vhost-user devices.

LKL clearly wants to have device implementations in the hypervisor,
perhaps for networking or console etc.? That _might_ be useful since it
makes the device implementation more general, unlike the UML approach
where all devices come with a kernel- and user-side and are special
drivers in the kernel, vs. general virtio drivers.

Now, arguably, since UML has all these already a combined UML/LKL
doesn't actually *need* any virtio devices, since all (or at least most)
of the things that could be covered by virtio today are already covered
by UML devices (block, net, console, random).

I'd probably say then that this can be removed from an initial "minimum
viable product" of LKL, since once merged with UML you get the devices
from that. Later, we could decide that UML devices actually are better
done as virtio, and support something like this.
