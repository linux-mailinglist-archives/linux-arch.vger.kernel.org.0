The end event is when a task is scheduled onto the CPU. The start event is
the first time it is woken up.

OK, how about this (currently we can only have 3 keys, but you can create
multiple histograms on the same event).

 # echo 'hist:keys=comm,stacktrace,delta.buckets=10:sort=delta' > /sys/kernel/tracing/events/synthetic/wakeup_lat/trigger

(notice the "stacktrace" in the keys)

# cat /sys/kernel/tracing/events/synthetic/wakeup_lat/hist
# event histogram
#
# trigger info: hist:keys=comm,stacktrace,delta.buckets=10:vals=hitcount:sort=delta.buckets=10:size=2048 [active]

Not the prettiest thing to read. But hey, we got the full stack of where
these latencies happened!

Yes, it adds some overhead when the events are triggered due to the
stacktrace code, but it's extremely useful information.

I call BS on that statement. Just because you do not know what has been
added to the kernel in the last 10 years (like you had no idea about
seq_buf and that was added in 2014) means to me that you are totally
clueless on what tracing can and can not do.

It appears to me that you are too focused on inventing your own wheel that
does exactly what you want before looking to see how things are today. Just
because something didn't fit your needs 10 years ago doesn't mean that it
can't fit your needs today.

I run it on production machines all the time. With the filtering in place
it has very little overhead. Mostly in the noise. The best part is that it
has practically zero overhead (but can add some cache pressure) when it's
off, and can be turned on at run time.

The tracing infrastructure is very modular, you can use parts of it that
you need, without the overhead of other parts. Like you found out this week
that tracepoints are not the same as trace events. Because tracepoints are
just a hook in the code that anything can attach to (that's what Daniel's
RV work does). Trace events provide the stored data to be recorded.

I will note that the current histogram code overhead has increased due to
retpolines, but I have code to convert them from indirect calls to direct
calls via a switch statement which drops the overhead by 20%!

I'm already getting complaints from customers/users that are saying there's
too many tools in the toolbox already. (Do we use ftrace/perf/bpf?). The
idea is to have the tools using mostly the same infrastructure, and not be
100% off on its own, unless there's a clear reason to invent a new wheel
that several people are asking for, not just one or two.
