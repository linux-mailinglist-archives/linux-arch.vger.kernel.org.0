Just to clarify. I only object to the blanket replacing all the
swp_entry_t to softleaf_t.
It seems you are not going to change the swp_entry_t for actual swap
usage, we are in alignment then.

BTW, about the name "softleaf_t", it does not reflect the nature of
this type is a not presented pte. If you have someone new to guess
what does  "softleaf_t" mean, I bet none of them would have guessed it
is a PTE  related value. I have considered  "idlepte_t", something
given to the reader by the idea that it is not a valid PTE entry. Just
some food for thought.

I did not expect you to delay this. It is just expressing the
viewpoint that this is internal clean up for benefit the developers
rather than the end users.

Keep the existing swp_entry_t for the actual core swap usage is within
reasonable request. We already align on that.
