Hi,

Thank you for the feedback!

Catalin did a great job explaining what this patch series does, I'll add my
own comments on top of his.

I don't think that's a problem either, today the user can specify multiple
CMA ranges on the kernel command line (via "cma", "hugetlb_cma", etc). CMA
already has the mechanism to keep track of multiple regions - it stores in
the cma_areas array.

You are correct, we settled on a new migrate type because the tag storage
memory is fundamentally a different memory type with different properties
than the rest of the memory in the system: tag storage memory cannot be
tagged, MIGRATE_CMA memory can be tagged.

I considered mixing the tag storage memory memory with normal memory and
adding it to MIGRATE_CMA. But since tag storage memory cannot be tagged,
this means that it's not enough anymore to have a __GFP_MOVABLE allocation
request to use MIGRATE_CMA.

I considered two solutions to this problem:

1. Only allocate from MIGRATE_CMA is the requested memory is not tagged =>
this effectively means transforming all memory from MIGRATE_CMA into the
MIGRATE_METADATA migratetype that the series introduces. Not very
appealing, because that means treating normal memory that is also on the
MIGRATE_CMA lists as tagged memory.

2. Keep track of which pages are tag storage at page granularity (either by
a page flag, or by checking that the pfn falls in one of the tag storage
region, or by some other mechanism). When the page allocator takes free
pages from the MIGRATE_METADATA list to satisfy an allocation, compare the
gfp mask with the page type, and if the allocation is tagged and the page
is a tag storage page, put it back at the tail of the free list and choose
the next page. Repeat until the page allocator finds a normal memory page
that can be tagged (some refinements obviously needed to need to avoid
infinite loops).

I considered solution 2 to be more complicated than keeping track of tag
storage page at the migratetype level. Conceptually, keeping two distinct
memory type on separate migrate types looked to me like the cleaner and
simpler solution.

Maybe I missed something, I'm definitely open to suggestions regarding
putting the tag storage pages on MIGRATE_CMA (or another migratetype) if
that's a better approach.

Might be worth pointing out that putting the tag storage memory on the
MIGRATE_CMA migratetype only changes how the page allocator allocates
pages; all the other changes to migration/compaction/mprotect/etc will
still be there, because they are needed not because of how the tag storage
memory is represented by the page allocator, but because tag storage memory
cannot be tagged, and regular memory can.
