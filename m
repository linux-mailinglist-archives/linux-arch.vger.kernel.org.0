TIL :) Btw, do you remember a discussion where this is clarified? A 
quick search didn't turn up anything.

You mean that they *intend to* cover? smp_read_barrier_depends never 
appears in the text, so anyone reading this section without prior 
knowledge has no way of realizing that this is what the sections are 
talking about.

On the other hand the implicit address dependency barriers that do exist 
are mentioned in the text. And that part is still true.

Let me quote a much wiser man than myself here: "

The problem is that people insist on diving into the middle of documents,
so sometimes repetition is a necessary form of self defense.  ;-)

"

The main reason I would like to add this here at the very top is that

- this section serves to frigthen children about the dangers of address 
dependencies,

- never mentions a way to add them - I need to happen to read another 
section of the manual to find that out

- and says this information is historical without specifying which parts 
are still relevant

(and the parts that are still there are all still relevant, while the 
parts that only the authors know was intended to be there and is 
out-of-date is already gone).

So I would add a disclaimer specifying that (since 4.15) *all* marked 
accesses imply read dependency barriers which resolve most of the issues 
mentioned in the remainder of the article.
However, some issues remain because the dependencies that are preserved 
by such barriers are just *semantic* dependencies, and readers should 
check rcu_dereference.rst for examples of what that implies.

I completely agree. I even considered removing address dependencies 
altogether from the company-internal memory models.
But people sometimes get a little bit angry and start asking many questions.
The valuable time of the model maintainer should be considered when 
designing memory models.

That's what I meant by "see the rcu file" --- include a link to 
rcu_dereference.rst in that paragraph.
So that people know to check out rcu_dereference.rst for more 
explanations to this effect.

Sounds good to me, but that doesn't mean we need to compromise the 
readability in the interim :)

Thanks for the response, I started thinking my mails aren't getting 
through again.

Have fun,
