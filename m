That's not what the current implementation does, when attributes is
equal 0 it clears the entries from the xarray:

static int kvm_vm_ioctl_set_mem_attributes(struct kvm *kvm,
					   struct kvm_memory_attributes *attrs)
{

    entry =3D attrs->attributes ? xa_mk_value(attrs->attributes) : NULL;
[...]
    for (i =3D start; i < end; i++)
    	if (xa_err(xa_store(&kvm->mem_attr_array, i, entry,
    			    GFP_KERNEL_ACCOUNT)))
        		break;
}

From Documentation/core-api/xarray.rst:

"There is no difference between an entry that has never
been stored to, one that has been erased and one that has most recently
had ``NULL`` stored to it."

The way I understood the series, there needs to be a differentiation
between no attributes (regular page fault) and no-access.

I'll do so with a clear head on Monday. :)
