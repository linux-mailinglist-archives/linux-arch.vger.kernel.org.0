force_sig_info() is called from an irq_work only: perf_pending_event
-> perf_pending_event_disable -> perf_sigtrap -> force_sig_info. What
did I miss?

Isn't perf_event_open() that API?

A new user API implementation will either be a thin wrapper around
perf events or reinvent half of perf events to deal with managing
watchpoints across a set of tasks (process-wide or some subset).

It's not just breakpoints though.

Fair enough. Although watchpoints can be much more fine-grained than
an mprotect() which then also has downsides (checking if the accessed
memory was actually the bytes we're interested in). Maybe we should
also ask CPU vendors to give us better watchpoints (perhaps start with
more of them, and easier to set in batch)? We still need a user space
API...
