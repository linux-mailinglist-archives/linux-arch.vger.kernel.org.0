Greetings My Beloved,
My name is Mrs.Pamela Griffin Wells. I am a cancer patient who had
decided to donate what I have to you. I am 59 years old and I was 
diagnosed of cancer disease for about 2 years ago. I lost my husband 
and was all left alone because I had no child.

I have no family and I'm going to go for an operation any moment from 
now, and I pray that if it pleases God,that I may survive the 
operation I have decided to WILL / DONATE the sum of
(Eight million five hundred thousand United States dollars) for the 
work of the Lord and charity purposes.

Currently, I have informed my attorney of my decision in
WILLING this fund to you. Please respond immediately so that I will provide your with further details on how to receive this fund.

Thank you and God bless you.

Mrs. Pamela Griffin Wells.
