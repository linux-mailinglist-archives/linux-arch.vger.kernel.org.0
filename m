Another question: right now we have
        if (!access_ok(uaddr, sizeof(u32)))
                return -EFAULT;

        ret = arch_futex_atomic_op_inuser(op, oparg, &oldval, uaddr);
        if (ret)
                return ret;
in kernel/futex.c.  Would there be any objections to moving access_ok()
inside the instances and moving pagefault_disable()/pagefault_enable() outside?

Reasons:
	* on x86 that would allow folding access_ok() with STAC into
user_access_begin().  The same would be doable on other usual suspects
(arm, arm64, ppc, riscv, s390), bringing access_ok() next to their
STAC counterparts.
	* pagefault_disable()/pagefault_enable() pair is universal on
all architectures, really meant to by the nature of the beast and
lifting it into kernel/futex.c would get the same situation as with
futex_atomic_cmpxchg_inatomic().  Which also does access_ok() inside
the primitive (also foldable into user_access_begin(), at that).
	* access_ok() would be closer to actual memory access (and
out of the generic code).

Comments?
