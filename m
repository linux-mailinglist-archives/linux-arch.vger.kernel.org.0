With no mappings in place for userspace VMM, IIUC, looks like the host
kernel will not be able to find the culprit userspace process in case
of Machine check error on guest private memory. As implemented in
hwpoison_user_mappings, host kernel tries to look at the processes
which have mapped the pfns with hardware error.

Is there a modification needed in mce handling logic of the host
kernel to immediately send a signal to the vcpu thread accessing
faulting pfn backing guest private memory?
