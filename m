Hello, Alex.

If we only avoid using ALLOC_CMA for __GFP_TAGGED, would we still be able to use
the next iteration even if the hardware does not support "tag of tag" ? 
I am not sure every vendor will support tag of tag, since there is no information
related to that feature, like in the Google spec document.

we are also looking into this.

Thanks,
Regards.
