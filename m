You said:
> Tag storage is not DMA and can live anywhere in memory.

Which I took as the kernel can figure out where to put it. But maybe
you meant the h/w platform can hard code it to be anywhere in memory?
If so, then yes, DT is needed.

If the tag storage lives in the middle of memory, then it would be
described in the memory node, but removed by being in reserved-memory
node.

Honestly, I just forgot about that part.
