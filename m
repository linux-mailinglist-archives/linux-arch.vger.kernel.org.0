I encountered a similar problem when writing the Tango binary
translator (https://www.amanieusystems.com/). Tango allows AArch32
programs to run on AArch64 CPUs that don't support AArch32 (e.g.
ThunderX). The technology has been licensed to several customers who
are primarily using it to run Android instances on cloud servers.

Doing compat system call translation entirely in user doesn't work out
for several reasons:
- As Ryan stated, it is impractical and error-prone to manually
translate all ioctls in user space. It would be much better to reuse
the existing compat layer in the kernel. This is even worse if you
take out-of-tree drivers (which have their own ioctls) into account.
- There are quite a few system calls which create VM mappings: the
usual suspects (mmap, etc) but also io_setup and some ioctls (e.g. in
the out-of-tree Mali GPU drivers).
- Seccomp filters simply don't work. They could be emulated in user
space but this is insecure since the translator is not designed to be
a secure sandbox. They also don't propagate across execve.
- Some syscalls rely on information that is only known to the kernel.
For example, a hugetlbfs fd can only be mapped at a huge page
boundary, but the translator cannot know this when selecting a virtual
address in the low 4GB for the mapping.

The solution that we ended up with was to allow AArch64 processes to
issue AArch32 syscalls by using a special system call number. This has
several effects for the duration of the syscall:
- The compat syscall table is used instead of the primary one.
- is_compat_task/in_compat_syscall return true.
- get_unmapped_area returns addresses below 4G and uses a separate
mmap_base. The separate mmap_base is needed to allow 32-bit
applications to benefit from address space randomization. Tango still
uses normal mmap syscalls for private memory allocations that are not
visible to the translated 32-bit process.
- KSTK_EIP and KSTK_ESP return the values of x13/x15 instead of pc/sp.
This is necessary for correct functioning seccomp filters and SELinux
checks respectively. Tango will set x13 and x15 to the correct values
when issuing a 32-bit syscall.
- System call restart after a signal sets things up so that
restart_syscall is executed as a 32-bit syscall after the signal.

I feel that a solution along these lines would also solve Ryan's
problem since the vast majority of the syscall translation work is
from the difference between 32-bit and 64-bit data structures in
memory. The remaining few differences in the syscall ABI between
AArch32 and x86-32 can be handled in user mode by the translator
program.

The kernel patch (based on the v5.4 LTS kernel) can be found at
https://github.com/Amanieu/linux/tree/tango-v5.4.
