On arm32 we rely on the compiler splitting a 64-bit argument in two
consecutive registers. But I wouldn't say it's a kludge (well, mostly)
as that's part of the arm procedure calling standard. Currently arm32
doesn't pass the syscall arguments through a read from pt_regs, so all
is handled transparently.

On arm64 compat, we need to re-assemble the arguments with some
wrappers explicitly (arch/arm64/kernel/sys32.c) or call the generic
wrapper like in the compat_sys_fanotify_mark() case.

I think it's fine in this particular case.

I don't think it's valid in general because of the arm (and maybe
others) requirement that the first register of a 64-bit argument is an
even number (IIRC, Russell should know better). If the u64 mask was an
argument before or after the current position, the compiler would have
introduced a pad register but not if the arg is split in two u32.
