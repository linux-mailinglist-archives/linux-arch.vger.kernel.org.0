Yeah, early loading is definitely important, especially before module
loading etc.

One common usecase is that we see a machine in the wild with a high
amount of kernel memory disappearing somewhere that isn't voluntarily
reported in vmstat/meminfo. Reproducing it isn't always
practical. Something that records early and always (with acceptable
runtime overhead) would be the holy grail.

Matching allocs to frees is doable using the pfn as the key for pages,
and virtual addresses for slab objects.

The biggest issue I had when I tried with bpf was losing updates to
the map. IIRC there is some trylocking going on to avoid deadlocks
from nested contexts (alloc interrupted, interrupt frees). It doesn't
sound like an unsolvable problem, though.

Another minor thing was the stack trace map exploding on a basically
infinite number of unique interrupt stacks. This could probably also
be solved by extending the trace extraction API to cut the frames off
at the context switch boundary.

Taking a step back though, given the multitude of allocation sites in
the kernel, it's a bit odd that the only accounting we do is the tiny
fraction of voluntary vmstat/meminfo reporting. We try to cover the
biggest consumers with this of course, but it's always going to be
incomplete and is maintenance overhead too. There are on average
several gigabytes in unknown memory (total - known vmstats) on our
machines. It's difficult to detect regressions easily. And it's per
definition the unexpected cornercases that are the trickiest to track
down. So it might be doable with BPF, but it does feel like the kernel
should do a better job of tracking out of the box and without
requiring too much plumbing and somewhat fragile kernel allocation API
tracking and probing from userspace.
