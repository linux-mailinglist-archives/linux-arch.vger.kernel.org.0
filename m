Ok then.  I'm a lazy a***** maintainer who wants to write safe code
without first having to understand the memory models of *multiple CPU
architectures*, and I'm perfectly fine with accepting the smallest
common featureset across those CPUs so that I can think as little as
possible about things outside my area of expertise.

Willy's proposed API looks good enough for me, and if that's all I ever
have to know, I'm good with that.  Eric's proposed recipes patch is a
decent breadcrumb should I ever desire to know more.  I don't expect
I'll read the LKMM, just like I don't expect any of the rest of you will
read the XFS internals book.

(Well, ok, I imagine Dave has...)
