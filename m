This is in my low-priority TODO list. I want to help you. I will possibly do this
after a month or two or three...

My solution will be different: I will create static /dev/console and /dev/null
after unpacking of builtin and external initramfs. (/dev/null because of
that bionic problem you somewhere wrote.)

Yeah, thank you for mkroot.

Yes, I plan to replace them with lore.kernel.org ones. This is in my low-priority
TODO list, too.

Yes, to distinguish builtin and external initramfs.

My plan is to change "official" names for these things.
"initramfs" will refer both to .cpio archive itself and to loading
mechanism. Name of GRUB's "initrd" command will become "wrong, kept for
compatibility".

But I plan to do all these renamings after I fully remove initrd support,
which will happen in September 2026, as I explained in another email.

I totally agree. I want to change it to ramfs/tmpfs. But this change
may break something, so I think we need some strong motivation to
do this. So I will wait for removal of nommu support. Arnd Bergmann said
"NOMMU removal maybe 2027" ( https://lwn.net/Articles/1035727/ ,
https://static.sched.com/hosted_files/osseu2025/75/32-bit%20Linux%20in%202025%20%28OSS%20Europe%29.pdf ,
slide 20). (Also he said 32-bit support will be removed, too.)
After that I will remove ramfs (yeah, I love to remove things),
and, while we are here, I will rename "rootfs" to "tmpfs" in
/proc/mounts (hopefully I will get away with this).

No. But I still hope new names are better. As I said above, all these
will be named "initramfs" under my new plan. But again, all these
will happen after full initrd removal, which will happen in Sep 2026.

You mean renaming CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INITRD will be good?
I do exactly that.
And while we are here, I also rename CONFIG_RD_*,
because configs will be broken anyway.

Also, recently we got keyword "transitional" to help with such
renamings: https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-6.18-Transitional .
I will use it.

It means "virtual address of external initramfs". But, yes, Borislav Petkov
said me in another email that kernel devs usually use "va" for virtual
address and "pa" for physical, so I will use these terms (in Sep 2026).

I'm still not convinced. Ideally I want to remove word "initrd" from Linux
sources completely.

Decision to merge my patches or not is on maintainers anyway. They
will decide whether these renamings are good idea.

I double-checked: ramdisk_start is used for initrd code path only
in modern kernels, not for initramfs code path.

"initrd=" is used in both code paths, and I keep it.

While we are here, let me answer other your emails, too.

Here is answer to https://lore.kernel.org/all/94023988-8498-4070-bdb7-6758dbe4b91d@landley.net/ .

I will consider fixing this, too. Put to my low-priority TODO list.

But it is possible that I will instead remove gen-init-cpio completely.
(I will do some experiments before deciding.)
If it was broken, and nobody except for you cared, then this means that
nobody except for you use it.

Of course, I will do that after sending patch for unconditional creating of
/dev/console and /dev/null, so you are safe.

Your explanation is wrong here. As you can see in Makefile, noinitramfs.c
is not built if there is BLK_DEV_INITRD.

If you don't have BLK_DEV_INITRD, then noinitramfs.c
is built, and it creates /dev/console.

If there is BLK_DEV_INITRD and there is no INITRAMFS_SOURCE, then
default built-in initramfs is used, which is specified here:
https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.17/source/usr/default_cpio_list
(and it happens to be equivalent to specified in noinitramfs.c).

If there are both BLK_DEV_INITRD and INITRAMFS_SOURCE, then
INITRAMFS_SOURCE is used instead of default built-in initramfs,
so there is no /dev/console.

I am totally sure that my explanation is correct.

> I could emit cpio contents with xxd -r from a HERE document hexdump or

There is no need for "xxd -r". cpio encoding of /dev/console is ASCII
(except for some null bytes). See:

$ echo /dev/console | cpio --create --format=newc --quiet | xxd

So, I think the following will go (not tested):

==
printf '%s' '0707010000000C0000218000000000000000000000000168D8C7BA00000000000000000000000600000005000000010000000D00000000/dev/console' > out.cpio
printf '\0\0' >> out.cpio
==

Maybe even last '\0\0' is not needed.

Also, this your email ( https://lore.kernel.org/all/94023988-8498-4070-bdb7-6758dbe4b91d@landley.net/ )
for some reasons didn't end up on https://lore.kernel.org/lkml .

As you can see here https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/94023988-8498-4070-bdb7-6758dbe4b91d@landley.net/ ,
the full list of lore mailing lists, which got it, is linux-snps-arc, linux-riscv and linux-sh .

I wrote about this to public-inbox:
http://public-inbox.org/meta/CAPnZJGB7ugY5rytS+hO-QzvPQBNjCh1jzs4WVkuakafBM9c_=w@mail.gmail.com/T/#u .
But it is possible that the problem is on your side.

Maybe this is why people ignore your emails? Maybe they simply don't get them?

Consider applying for linux.dev email ( https://linux.dev ). They are free for linux devs.

Now let me answer to https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/8f595eec-e85e-4c1f-acb0-5069a01c1012@landley.net/T/#u .

I totally agree.

Still I somehow was able to manage this.

Again: I totally agree. I just want to share some practical advice, that helped me
to get my patches merged.

As you can see, I was able to get my patches merged:
https://lore.kernel.org/all/?q=f:%22Askar%20Safin%22 .

And this is despite nobody paid me for this. I do this in my own free time.

As well as I understand, you are doing embedded Linux development as your job,
so you are in better position.

My patches are merged despite my productivity is low. I am very slow person.

You don't need to remember all of submitting-patches.rst . Just do this:

- Run checkpatch.pl . It accepts git ranges, e. g. "checkpatch.pl origin/HEAD..HEAD"
- After posting patches respond to comments, apply their edits, send new version, then again and again

When sending patches and responding to comments don't write too long letters.
Nobody will carefully read long letters and respond to them.
I respond to such letters, because I'm autistic, and I feel responsibility to carefully
read and respond to each letter. But other people don't do this.

In particular, when sending patches and responding to comments don't write long
paragraphs about good things you did in the past and about how you are disappointed
in the entire world, such as these:

Again: I'm not trying to insult you. I'm just trying to give advice how
to get your patches merged.

When my patches are ready, I send them using something like this:

==
UPSTREAM=origin/HEAD
MERGE_BASE="$(git merge-base "$UPSTREAM" HEAD)"

mkdir /tmp/patches

# For --signoff
export GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL=me@example.com

# Prepare patches
# --base for "base-commit:" footer
git format-patch --cover-letter --find-renames --base="$MERGE_BASE" --signoff -o /tmp/patches \
  --subject-prefix='PATCH v2' "$MERGE_BASE"

editor /tmp/patches/0000-cover-letter.patch

# Send
# "--batch-size=1 --relogin-delay=20" to insert delays between patches. Hopefully
# this will help me to cope with my mailserver limits
# "--confirm=" to give myself chance to cancel
git send-email --batch-size=1 --relogin-delay=20 --confirm=always --to=a@example.com --cc=b@example.com \
  /tmp/patches
==

This script will automatically generate nice diffstat in cover letter.

This script is not tested. Actually I use my own 182-line Rust program, which does
same thing.

This is checklist I plan to do when sending v2 version of this initrd patchset:
- Read all answers to prev. version, respond and apply edits
- checkpatch.pl
- Check that my patchset doesn't conflict with linux-next
- Check that every commit compiles for x86_64 with "W=1"
- Test everything using mkroot.sh rewritten in Rust

> Why keep the section when you removed the old mechanism?

This section still contains useful info, so I kept it.
But okay, I agree, I will rewrite it to not mention initrd.
I will do this after full removal of initrd, i. e. in Sep 2026.

If you want me to send some patch to this document _now_,
then just ask me, I will try to do this.

> Those two lines you just touched contradict each other

Will fix in Sep 2026, too.

You cannot directly call syscall from kernel code if your syscall
works with strings. Reasons are here: https://lwn.net/Articles/832121/ .

mkdir syscall expects string, located in user memory. So you
cannot call it from kernel and pass kernel string to it.
Thus you need separate init_mkdir.

I just double-checked. If BLK_DEV_INITRD is disabled, then
there is no any builtin initramfs at all. If BLK_DEV_INITRD is
disabled, then initramfs_data.S is not built, as we can see here:

https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.17/source/usr/Makefile#L15

And initramfs_data.S contains symbol __initramfs_size, so, yes,
initramfs_data.S is actual builtin initramfs.

In fact, that "obj-$(CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INITRD) :=" trick
is not needed, because whole usr/ dir is compiled out,
if there is no BLK_DEV_INITRD:
https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.17/source/init/Kconfig#L1455

Again: I acknoledge that bug with missing /dev/console. In fact,
I was able to reproduce it. I plan to fix it in a month or two.

This is possible that court will use this file as an argument.
So let's keep this paragraph here. :)

There is an example, where FAQ on FSF site was actually
used as argument in court: https://www.sonarsource.com/blog/will-the-new-judicial-ruling-in-the-vizio-lawsuit-strengthen-the-gpl/ .

I mean this quote:

> Vizio “did not dispute” the first two questions, focusing instead on the “expectations” of the contracting parties.
> Relying on the Free Software Foundation’s (FSF) GPL FAQs, it argued that the FSF never intended for third parties to enforce the contract,
> and therefore the parties to the contract could not have intended it.

Yes, grub still calls it "initrd".
As I said, in Sep 2026 I will rename bootloader loading mechanism to "initramfs",
and name of grub command "initrd" will simply become "wrong".

> A) they added -hda so you don't have to give it a dummy /dev/zero anymore.

Ok, I will fix.

Ok, I will fix.
