Yeah, but these are C macros, and here is the commit log, so I wasn't so

Sounds good, I will use this in the next version.

The reason I prelude them is because that `READ_ONCE` and `WRITE_ONCE`
have total ~7000 users in kernel, but now think about it, maybe it's
better not.

Right, it's the documentation for both functions.

Actually I haven't found any document about `READ_ONCE()` races with
writes is not UB: we do have document saying `READ_ONCE()` will disable
KCSAN checks, but no document says (explicitly) that it's not a UB.

I actually explained this above, after "---" of the commit log, but
maybe it's worth its own documentation? The reason that it only works
with `T: Copy`, is that these primitives should be mostly used for
C/Rust communication, and using a `T: !Copy` is probably wrong (or at
least complicated) for communication, since users need to handle which
one should be used after `read_once()`. This is in the same spirit as
`read_volatile` documentation:

```
Like read, read_volatile creates a bitwise copy of T, regardless of
whether T is Copy. If T is not Copy, using both the returned value and
the value at *src can violate memory safety. However, storing non-Copy
types in volatile memory is almost certainly incorrect.
```

I want to start with restrict usage.

I'd rather not claim this (no invalid codegen), not because it's not
true, but because it's not under our control. We have written doc in
Rust says:

```
... so the precise semantics of what “volatile” means here is subject
to change over time. That being said, the semantics will almost always
end up pretty similar to C11’s definition of volatile.
```

, so we have some confidence to say `read_volatile` equals to a volatile
read, and `write_volatile` equals to a volatile write. Therefore, we can
assume they have the same behaviors as `READ_ONCE()` and `WRITE_ONCE()`,
but that's it. Going futher to talk about codegen means we have more
guarantee from Rust compiler implementation.

In other words, we are not saying racing `read_volatile`s don't have
UBs, we are saying racing `read_volatile`s behave the same as a volatile
read on UBs.
