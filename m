I spent half of dinner last night being complained to by one of our
hardware engineers about Linux's lack of support for the flags argument
to fchmodat().  This all came about because of a FUSE filesystem
implementation, and while there are some application-specific
workarounds for the issue it seemed to me like the cleanest bet was to
just go add another fchmodat() that supports flags to the kernel.

The actual implementation is super simple: essentially it's just
the same as fchmodat(), but LOOKUP_FOLLOW is conditionally set based on
the flags.  I've attempted to make this match "man 2 fchmodat" as
closely as possible, which says EINVAL is returned for invalid flags (as
opposed to ENOTSUPP, which is currently returned by glibc for
AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW).  I have a sketch of a glibc patch that I haven't
even compiled yet, but seems fairly straight-forward:

    diff --git a/sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/fchmodat.c b/sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/fchmodat.c

     }

I've never added a new syscall before so I'm not really sure what the
proper procedure to follow is.  I'm assuming any new syscall will
involve fairly significant discussion, so I've just done the minimum of
an implementation for this patch set.  Specifically, I've:

* Defined a new syscall that looks like fchmodat but includes a flag
  argument, which I'm calling fchmodat4 because it has 4 arguments.  I
  don't know if that's the correct naming convention, and don't really
  have any skin in that game.
* Implemented that syscall by extending the fchmod code to handle flags,
  which is pretty straight-forward.  I think it's sane, but given that
  it's so simple I'm not sure if I'm missing something -- specifically,
  I didn't go check to make sure the semantics of AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW
  match !LOOKUP_FOLLOW.  I'm assuming the do, but sometimes when I look
  at something and say "that's so simple, how is it broken" I'm actually
  just missing something entirely.
* Added an asm-generic syscall number for this, which I assume I'm
  supposed to do this first as it looks like we're trying to keep the
  numbers in sync everywhere.
* Added x86 syscalls for this so I could test it.

I also cleaned up a checkpatch issue in fchmodat().  I only found this
because I copied the fchmodat() interface for fchmodat4() and it threw
the warning, I don't personally care either way as to whether or not the
space is in there.

I've given this fairly minimal testing.  Essentially all I've done is
booted up 5.1.6 with this patch set on my local development box and run

    $ touch test-file
    $ ln -s test-file test-link
    $ cat > test.c
    #include <fcntl.h>
    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <unistd.h>
    
    int main(int argc, char **argv)
    {
            long out;
    
            out = syscall(428, AT_FDCWD, "test-file", 0x888, AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW);
            printf("fchmodat4(AT_FDCWD, \"test-file\", 0x888, AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW): %ld\n", out);
    
            out = syscall(428, AT_FDCWD, "test-file", 0x888, 0);
            printf("fchmodat4(AT_FDCWD, \"test-file\", 0x888, 0): %ld\n", out);
    
            out = syscall(268, AT_FDCWD, "test-file", 0x888);
            printf("fchmodat(AT_FDCWD, \"test-file\", 0x888): %ld\n", out);
    
            out = syscall(428, AT_FDCWD, "test-link", 0x888, AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW);
            printf("fchmodat4(AT_FDCWD, \"test-link\", 0x888, AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW): %ld\n", out);
    
            out = syscall(428, AT_FDCWD, "test-link", 0x888, 0);
            printf("fchmodat4(AT_FDCWD, \"test-link\", 0x888, 0): %ld\n", out);
    
            out = syscall(268, AT_FDCWD, "test-link", 0x888);
            printf("fchmodat(AT_FDCWD, \"test-link\", 0x888): %ld\n", out);
    
            return 0;
    }
    $ gcc test.c -o test
    $ ./test
    fchmodat4(AT_FDCWD, "test-file", 0x888, AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW): 0
    fchmodat4(AT_FDCWD, "test-file", 0x888, 0): 0
    fchmodat(AT_FDCWD, "test-file", 0x888): 0
    fchmodat4(AT_FDCWD, "test-link", 0x888, AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW): -1
    fchmodat4(AT_FDCWD, "test-link", 0x888, 0): 0
    fchmodat(AT_FDCWD, "test-link", 0x888): 0

While I don't think there's any reason what's there is unacceptable, I
don't really consider this finished.  I couldn't find a cookbook for
"here's how you add a system call", but all I really did was "git grep
add | grep syscall" so if there's something out there then please let me
know and I'll follow it.  Specifically, I haven't:

* Added any sort of documentation.  I don't find anything with a "git
  grep fchmodat", so I'm assuming it's just the man pages that are
  relevant here.
* Fixed any of the other architectures.  I'm assuming this is just the
  mechanical process of fixing all these in the same way I did for x86.

* Done anything with userspace, aside from thinking about the glibc code
  above.  I'd assume that I'm meant to bring in libc-alpha to the
  discussion, but I didn't want to do so this early in case this was
  just a non-starter.

I'm happy dealing with all of that, but given that I'm assuming there's
going to be some discussion I wanted to send out the proof-of-concept
first to see if this has any legs.  Aside from the glibc side the
remaining work smells pretty mechanical, so I figured I'd wait on that
until I knew it wasn't going to be a waste of time -- partially because
I'm lazy, but mostly because I just realized I blew my whole morning
working on this when all I really wanted to do was avoid discussing
fchmodat in the first place :)
