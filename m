I know I sound like a broken record since I've been going on about this
forever together with a lot of other people but honestly,
the fact that people are running untrusted workloads in privileged containers
is the real issue here.

Aleksa is a good friend of mine and we have discussed this a lot so I hope
he doesn't hate me for saying this again: it is crazy that there are container
runtimes out there that promise (or at least do not state the opposite)
containers without user namespaces or containers with user namespaces
that allow to map the host root id to anything can be safe. They cannot.

Even if this /proc/*/exe thing is somehow blocked there
are other ways of escaping from a privileged container.
We (i.e. LXC) literally do not accept CVEs for privileged containers
because we do not consider them safe by design.
It seems to me to be heading in the wrong direction to keep up the
illusion that with enough effort we can make this all nice and safe.
Yes, the userspace memfd hack we came up with is as ugly as a security
patch can be but if you make promises you can't keep you better be
prepared to pay the price when things start to fall apart.
So if this part of the patch is just needed to handle this do we really
want to do all that tricky work or is there more to gain from this that
makes it worth it.
