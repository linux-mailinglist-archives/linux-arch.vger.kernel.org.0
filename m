I was just wondering if it was intentional, since you did it below.

I think we should start out with it not in the prelude. Drivers should
not need to call this often (I hope that only abstractions actually need
this).

That will not work, it will just be rendered only on `read_once`.

Maybe just copy it to both and also cross link the two functions.
So `read_once` mentions the counterpart `write_once`.

Oh I missed that, sorry.

Yeah, lets document it. Otherwise I agree with your reasoning.

But it is under our control, we pin the compiler version and can always
just check if the codegen is correct. If someone finds that it is not,
we also want to be informed, so I think we should write that we rely on
it here.

But this is not a guarantee, that they behave exactly the same as C11
_now_.
