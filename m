Makes sense! I'll send a v2 with that in a couple of days if nothing
else comes up.

You'd need a barrier *before* the READ_ONCE(), since what we're trying
to prevent is a consumer from writing to the value without being able to
observe the writes that happened prior, while this side read the old
value. A barrier after the READ_ONCE() doesn't do anything, as that read
is the last memory operation in this thread (of the problematic sequence).

At that point, I'm not sure DMB LD / early read / LSE atomic would be
any faster than just always doing the LSE atomic?
