What is wrong with using a file descriptor to a possibly deleted file
and re-mmaping it?

There is already MAP_FIXED that allows you to ensure you have the same
address.

I think all it would take would be a small protocol from one version
to the next to say map file descriptor #N and address #A.  Something
easily passed on the command line.

There is just enough complexity in exec currently that our
implementation of exec is already teetering.  So if we could use
existing mechanisms it would be good.

And I don't see why this version of sharing a mmap area would be
particularly general.  I do imagine that being able to force a
mmap area into a setuid executable would be a fun attack vector.

Perhaps I missed this in my skim of these patches but I did not see
anything that guarded this feature against an exec that changes an
applications privileges.
