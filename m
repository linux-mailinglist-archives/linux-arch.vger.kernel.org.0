No, not at all. "elf2flt" is exactly what it does. Couldn't get a
more accurate name.

Inertia. Flat format has been around a very long time.
And for most people it just works. Flat format works on MMU systems
as well, though you would have to be crazy to choose to do that.

Well flat got half way there. You can have separate text/rodata and data/bss,
used a lot back in the day for execute-in-place of the code.
