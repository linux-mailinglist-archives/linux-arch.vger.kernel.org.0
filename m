No, that doesn't seem like the right solution.

Perhaps then with that toolchain (or configuration thereof) we need to
provide __init_array_start/end labels?

Or ... maybe that actually just needs to be removed, so that the
toolchain gets to choose?

Hmm. Pretty sure it worked for me, I think also with gcc 10, but not
sure exactly where I tested.
