Currently we check that TSC page is valid on every read and it seems
this is redundant, right? It is either available on boot or not. I can
only imagine migrating a VM to a non-InvariantTSC host when Hyper-V will
likely disable the page (and we can get reenlightenment notification
then).

The issue needs fixing, I agree, however using MSR based clocksource as
sched clock may give us too big of a performance hit (not sure who cares
about 32 bit guest performance nowadays but still). What stops us from
enabling TSC page for 32 bit guests if it is available?
