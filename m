So we're talking about regular membarrier() then? Not the SYNC_CORE
variant per-se.

Even there, I'll argue we don't care, but perhaps Mathieu has a
different opinion. All we care about is that all other threads (or CPUs
for GLOBAL) observe an smp_mb() before it returns.

Any serialization against whatever those other threads/CPUs are running
at the instant of the syscall is external to the syscall, we make no
gauarantees about that. That is, we can fundamentally not say what
another CPU is executing concurrently. Nor should we want to.

So if you feel that your membarrier() ought to serialize against remote
execution, you need to arrange a quiecent state on the remote side
yourself.

Now, normally membarrier() is used to implement userspace RCU like
things, and there all that matters is that the remote CPUs observe the
beginngin of the new grace-period, ie counter flip, and we observe their
read-side critical sections, or smething like that, it's been a while
since I looked at all that.

It's always been the case that concurrent syscalls could change user
memory, io_uring doesn't change that, it just makes it even less well
defined when that would happen. If you want to serialize against that,
you need to arrange that externally.
