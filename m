Thanks for adding me to the discussion!

One reason not to rely on C11 is that old compilers don't support it, 
and there may be application scenarios in which new compilers haven't 
been certified.
I don't know if this is something that affects linux, but linux is so 
big and versatile I'd be surprised if that's irrelevant.

Another is that the C11 model is more about atomic locations than atomic 
accesses, and there are several places in the kernel where a location is 
accessed both atomically and non-atomically. This API mismatch is more 
severe than the semantic differences in my opinion, since you don't have 
guarantees of what the layout of atomics is going to be.

Perhaps you could instead rely on the compiler builtins? Note that this 
may invalidate some progress properties, e.g., ticket locks become 
unfair if the increment (for taking a ticket) is implemented with a CAS 
loop (because a thread can fail forever to get a ticket if the ticket 
counter is contended, and thus starve). There may be some linux atomics 
that don't map to any compiler builtins and need to implemented with 
such CAS loops, potentially leading to such problems.

I'm also curious whether link time optimization can resolve the inlining 
issue?

I think another big question for me is to which extent it makes sense 
anyways to have shared memory concurrency between the Rust code and the 
C code. It seems all the bad concurrency stuff from the C world would 
flow into the Rust world, right?
If you can live without shared Rust & C concurrency, then perhaps you 
can get away without using LKMM in Rust at all, and just rely on its 
(C11-like) memory model internally and talk to the C code through 
synchronous, safer ways.

I'm not against having a fallback builtin-based implementation of LKMM, 
and I don't think that it really needs architecture audits. What it 
needs is some additional compiler barriers and memory barriers, to 
ensure that the arguments about dependencies and non-atomics still hold. 
E.g., a release store may not just be "builtin release store" but may 
need to have a compiler barrier to prevent the release store being moved 
in program order. And a "full barrier" exchange may need an mb() infront 
of the operation to avoid "roach motel ordering" (i.e.,Â  x=1 ; "full 
barrier exchange"; y = 1 allows y=1 to execute before x=1 in the 
compiler builtins as far as I remember). And there may be some other 
cases like this.

But I currently don't see that this implementation would be noticeably 
faster than paying the overhead of lack of inline.

Best wishes, jonas
