Right, that's all a variant of banging on the same resources across
nodes. I'm not sure there's anything fundamental we can fix there.

A numa aware rework of futexes has been on the todo list for years :/

Actual benchmarks with performance numbers are required. It helps
motivate the patches as well as gives reviewers clues on how to
reproduce / inspect the claims made.
