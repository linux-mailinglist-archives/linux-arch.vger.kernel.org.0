It doesn=E2=80=99t have to be spawn per se.  But the current situation suck=

I=E2=80=99ve literally never spoken to an MS person about it.

What container managers and init systems *want* is a way to drop
privileges, change namespaces, etc and then run something in a
controlled way so that the intermediate states aren=E2=80=99t dangerous. An
API for this could be spawn-like or exec-like =E2=80=94 that particular
distinction is beside the point.  Having personally written code that
mucks with namepsaces, I've wanted two particular abilities that are
both quite awkward:

a) Change all my UIDs and GIDs to match a container, enter that
container's namespaces, and run some binary in the container's
filesystem, all atomically enough that I don't need to worry about
accidentally leaking privileges into the container.  A
super-duper-non-dumpable mode would kind of allow this, but I'd worry
that there's some other hole besides ptrace() and /proc/self.

b) Change all my UIDs and GIDs to match a container, enter that
container's namespaces, and run some binary that is *not* in the
container's filesystem.  This happens, for example, if the container's
mount namespace has no exec mounts at all.  We don't have a fantastic
way to do this at all right now due to /proc/self/exe.

Regardless, the actual CVE at hand would have been nicely avoided if
writing to /proc/self/exe didn=E2=80=99t work, and I see no reason we can=
=E2=80=99t
make that happen.

I suppose we could also consider a change to disable /proc/self/exe if
it's not reachable from /proc/self/root.  By "disable", I mean that
readlink() should maybe still work, but actually trying to open it
could probably fail safely.
