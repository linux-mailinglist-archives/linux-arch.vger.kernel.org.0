Well, there is really a lot of thought and willingness for engineering
effort to address the fact there must be high confidence that the
shutdown with panic() really works.

The proper start and restart of the kernel is actually another
issue... but there various sanity checks are possible before the
system switches into a mode that could potentially harm people (cause
physical damage, directly or indirectly).
