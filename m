I've almost completed the removal of compat_alloc_user_space(),
that should no longer be a concern when the syscall gets added.

What the ioctls() actually check is 'in_compat_syscall()', which is not
the mode of the task but the type of syscall. There is actually a general
trend to use this helper more rather than less, and I think the only
way forward here is to ensure that this returns true when entering
through the new syscall number.

For x86, this has another complication, as some ioctls also need to
check whether they are in an ia32 task (with packed u64 and 32-bit
__kernel_old_time_t) or an x32 task (with aligned u64 and 64-bit
__kernel_old_time_t). If the new syscall gets wired up on x86 as well,
you'd need to decide which of the two behaviors you want.

What kind of allocation do you mean here? Can you give an example of
an ioctl that does this?

I think there are only a few ioctls that are affected, and you can
probably get a list from qemu, which emulates them in user space
already. Doing that transformation should not be all that hard
in the end.

If we want to do this in the kernel, this probably requires changes
to the syscall calling convention. Adding a flag to pick a particular
style of ioctl arguments would work, and this could enable the
case of emulating arm32 ioctls on x86-64 hosts.

I'm not sure why you want this in 32-bit processes, can't they just call
the normal ioctl() function?

These two look identical to me, I don't think you need to add a wrapper
here at all, but can just use the normal compat_sys_ioctl entry point
unless you want to add a 'flags' argument to control the struct padding.

(already mentioned on IRC)

If you add it here, the same number should be assigned across all architectures,
or at least a comment added to declare the number as reserved, to keep
the following syscalls in sync.
