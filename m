Thanks very much for the info. But I'm not so confident that the current
memfd_restricted() implementation can be useful for all these usages.

I'm trying to form my understanding on how this could work and what's
the benefit for a DomU guest to provide memory through memfd_restricted().
AFAICS, memfd_restricted() can help to hide the memory from DomU userspace,
but I assume VirtIO backends are still in DomU uerspace and need access
that memory, right?

Right, we already had some discussions on this in the past versions.

Okay, but normal memfd_create() should work for it, right? And
memfd_restricted() instead may not work as it unmaps the memory from
userspace.

Sounds to me these are the places where normal memfd_create() can act on.
VirtIO backends work on the mmap-ed memory which currently is not the
case for memfd_restricted(). memfd_restricted() has different design
purpose that unmaps the memory from userspace and employs some kernel
callbacks so other kernel modules can make use of the memory with these
callbacks instead of userspace virtual address.
