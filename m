FWIW, vfs.git#for-next is always a merge of independent branches; I don't
put stuff directly into #for-next - too easy to lose that way.

IOW, that would be something like #base.set_fs, included into #for-next
merge set.  And I've no problem with never-rebased branches...

Where in the mainline are the most recent prereqs of this series?
