Unless I missed some machinations, which is entirely possible, you can=E2=80=
=99t call force_sig_info() from NMI context. Not only am I not convinced tha=
t the core signal code is NMI safe, but at least x86 can=E2=80=99t correctly=
 deliver signals on NMI return. You probably need an IPI-to-self.

This would be doable much more simply with an API to set a breakpoint.  All t=
he machinery exists except the actual user API.

Cute.

I=E2=80=99m skeptical. Propagating a hardware breakpoint to all threads invo=
lves IPIs and horribly slow writes to DR1 (or 2, 3, or 4) and DR7.  A TLB fl=
ush can be accelerated using paravirt or hypothetical future hardware. Or re=
al live hardware on ARM64.

(The hypothetical future hardware is almost present on Zen 3.  A bit of work=
 is needed on the hardware end to make it useful.)
