I will let you take that one up with the Power folks.

But I should give an example of a current difference between lock and
acquire, and just to spread the blame, I will pick on an architecture
other than Power.  ;-)

With lock acquisition, the following orders the access to X and Z:

	WRITE_ONCE(X, 1);
	spin_lock(&my_lock);
	smp_mb__after_lock();
	r1 = READ_ONCE(Z);

But if we replace the lock acquisition with a load acquire, there are
no ordering guarantees for the accesses to X and Z:

	WRITE_ONCE(X, 1);
	r2 = smp_load_acquire(&Y);
	smp_mb__after_lock();  // Yeah, there is no lock.  ;-)
	r3 = READ_ONCE(Z);

There -is- ordering between the accesses to Y and Z, but not to X and Z.
This is not a theoretical issue.  The x86 platform really can reorder
the access to X to follow that of both Y and Z.

So the memory-model divergence between lock acquisition and acquire
loads is very real in the here and now.

							Thanx, Paul
