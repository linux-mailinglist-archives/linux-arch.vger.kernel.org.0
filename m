No, because the tag storage would be reserved in /reserved-memory.

Of course, the arch code could do something between scanning /memory
nodes and /reserved-memory, but that would be broken arch code.
Ideally, there wouldn't be any arch code in between those 2 points,
but it's complicated. It used to mainly be powerpc, but we keep adding
to the complexity on arm64.

But better to just not reserve the region in the first place. Also, it
needs to be simple enough to back port.

Also, does free_reserved_page() work on ranges outside of memblock
range (e.g. beyond end_of_DRAM())? If the tag storage happened to live
at the end of DRAM and you shorten the /memory node size to remove tag
storage, is it still going to work?
