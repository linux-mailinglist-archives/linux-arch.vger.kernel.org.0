Subject: [PATCH v6 00/29] context_tracking,x86: Defer some IPIs until a user->kernel transition

Context
=======

We've observed within Red Hat that isolated, NOHZ_FULL CPUs running a
pure-userspace application get regularly interrupted by IPIs sent from
housekeeping CPUs. Those IPIs are caused by activity on the housekeeping CPUs
leading to various on_each_cpu() calls, e.g.:

  64359.052209596    NetworkManager       0    1405     smp_call_function_many_cond (cpu=0, func=do_kernel_range_flush)
    smp_call_function_many_cond+0x1
    smp_call_function+0x39
    on_each_cpu+0x2a
    flush_tlb_kernel_range+0x7b
    __purge_vmap_area_lazy+0x70
    _vm_unmap_aliases.part.42+0xdf
    change_page_attr_set_clr+0x16a
    set_memory_ro+0x26
    bpf_int_jit_compile+0x2f9
    bpf_prog_select_runtime+0xc6
    bpf_prepare_filter+0x523
    sk_attach_filter+0x13
    sock_setsockopt+0x92c
    __sys_setsockopt+0x16a
    __x64_sys_setsockopt+0x20
    do_syscall_64+0x87
    entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x65

The heart of this series is the thought that while we cannot remove NOHZ_FULL
CPUs from the list of CPUs targeted by these IPIs, they may not have to execute
the callbacks immediately. Anything that only affects kernelspace can wait
until the next user->kernel transition, providing it can be executed "early
enough" in the entry code.

The original implementation is from Peter [1]. Nicolas then added kernel TLB
invalidation deferral to that [2], and I picked it up from there.

Deferral approach
=================

Storing each and every callback, like a secondary call_single_queue turned out
to be a no-go: the whole point of deferral is to keep NOHZ_FULL CPUs in
userspace for as long as possible - no signal of any form would be sent when
deferring an IPI. This means that any form of queuing for deferred callbacks
would end up as a convoluted memory leak.

Deferred IPIs must thus be coalesced, which this series achieves by assigning
IPIs a "type" and having a mapping of IPI type to callback, leveraged upon
kernel entry.

Kernel entry vs execution of the deferred operation
===================================================

This is what I've referred to as the "Danger Zone" during my LPC24 talk [4].

There is a non-zero length of code that is executed upon kernel entry before the
deferred operation can be itself executed (before we start getting into
context_tracking.c proper), i.e.:

  idtentry_func_foo()                <--- we're in the kernel
    irqentry_enter()
      irqentry_enter_from_user_mode()
	enter_from_user_mode()
	  [...]
	    ct_kernel_enter_state()
	      ct_work_flush()        <--- deferred operation is executed here

This means one must take extra care to what can happen in the early entry code,
and that <bad things> cannot happen. For instance, we really don't want to hit
instructions that have been modified by a remote text_poke() while we're on our
way to execute a deferred sync_core(). Patches doing the actual deferral have
more detail on this.

The annoying one: TLB flush deferral
====================================

While leveraging the context_tracking subsystem works for deferring things like
kernel text synchronization, it falls apart when it comes to kernel range TLB
flushes. Consider the following execution flow:

  <userspace>
  
  !interrupt!

  SWITCH_TO_KERNEL_CR3        <--- vmalloc range becomes accessible

  idtentry_func_foo()
    irqentry_enter()
      irqentry_enter_from_user_mode()
	enter_from_user_mode()
	  [...]
	    ct_kernel_enter_state()
	      ct_work_flush() <--- deferred flush would be done here


Since there is no sane way to assert no stale entry is accessed during
kernel entry, any code executed between SWITCH_TO_KERNEL_CR3 and
ct_work_flush() is at risk of accessing a stale entry.

Dave had suggested hacking up something within SWITCH_TO_KERNEL_CR3 itself,
which is what has been implemented in the new RFC patches.

How bad is it?
==============

Code
++++

I'm happy that the COALESCE_TLBI asm code fits in ~half a screen,
although it open-codes native_write_cr4() without the pinning logic.

I hate the kernel_cr3_loaded signal; it's a kludgy context_tracking.state
duplicate but I need *some* sort of signal to drive the TLB flush deferral and
the context_tracking.state one is set too late in kernel entry. I couldn't
find any fitting existing signals for this.

I'm also unhappy to introduce two different IPI deferral mechanisms. I tried
shoving the text_poke_sync() in KERNEL_SWITCH_CR3, but it got ugly(er) really
fast. 

Performance
+++++++++++

Tested by measuring the duration of 10M `syscall(SYS_getpid)` calls on
NOHZ_FULL CPUs, with rteval (hackbench + kernel compilation) running on the
housekeeping CPUs:

o Xeon E5-2699:   base avg 770ns,  patched avg 1340ns (74% increase)
o Xeon E7-8890:   base avg 1040ns, patched avg 1320ns (27% increase)
o Xeon Gold 6248: base avg 270ns,  patched avg 273ns  (.1% increase)

I don't get that last one, I did spend a ridiculous amount of time making sure
the flush was being executed, and AFAICT yes, it was. What I take out of this is
that it can be a pretty massive increase in the entry overhead (for NOHZ_FULL
CPUs), and that's something I want to hear thoughts on

Noise
+++++

Xeon E5-2699 system with SMToff, NOHZ_FULL, isolated CPUs.
RHEL10 userspace.

Workload is using rteval (kernel compilation + hackbench) on housekeeping CPUs
and a dummy stay-in-userspace loop on the isolated CPUs. The main invocation is:

$ trace-cmd record -e "ipi_send_cpumask" -f "cpumask & CPUS{$ISOL_CPUS}" \
	           -e "ipi_send_cpu"     -f "cpu & CPUS{$ISOL_CPUS}" \
		   rteval --onlyload --loads-cpulist=$HK_CPUS \
		   --hackbench-runlowmem=True --duration=$DURATION

This only records IPIs sent to isolated CPUs, so any event there is interference
(with a bit of fuzz at the start/end of the workload when spawning the
processes). All tests were done with a duration of 6 hours.

v6.17
o ~5400 IPIs received, so about ~200 interfering IPI per isolated CPU
o About one interfering IPI just shy of every 2 minutes

v6.17 + patches
o Zilch!

Patches
=======

o Patches 1-2 are standalone objtool cleanups.

o Patches 3-4 add an RCU testing feature.

o Patches 5-6 add infrastructure for annotating static keys and static calls
  that may be used in noinstr code (courtesy of Josh).
o Patches 7-20 use said annotations on relevant keys / calls.
o Patch 21 enforces proper usage of said annotations (courtesy of Josh).

o Patch 22 deals with detecting NOINSTR text in modules

o Patches 23-24 deal with kernel text sync IPIs

o Patches 25-29 deal with kernel range TLB flush IPIs
