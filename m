That's a pretty good description of most error messages for modern
software packages. Anything that is a non-trivial error requires web
searching to understand and diagnose these days.

Google knows exactly what you are looking for if you search for
"mount structure needs cleaning" or other similar error messages.
That means users also know what it means and what they need to
do to address it.  i.e. it's been around long enough that there's a
deep history in internet search engines and question forums like
stackexchange.

Message grammar is largely irrelevant. And not unique to EUCLEAN. e.g.
EAGAIN = "Try again".

It's pretty silly to argue that a developer crafting and/or fuzzing
corrupted filesystem images is not going to understand what the
error message returned when they successfully corrupt a filesystem
actually means....

Damned if you do, damned if you don't.

Back in 2005-2006, XFS developers tried to make EFSCORRUPTED a
proper system wide errno (like we had on Irix). The NIH was strong
in the linux community back then, and we were largely told to go
away as the superior Linux filesystems would never need to report
corruption to userspace so we don't need a special errno just
because some shitty Irix filesystem port needs it.

And so we didn't get a new errno and went with the second choice:
precedence set by older unix systems....

commit 9e1fd551aba7291564d5d6c28948405142d5e2ca

    Map EFSCORRUPTED to an actual error code, not just a made up one
    (990).  Turns out some ye-olde unices used EUCLEAN as
    Filesystem-needs-cleaning, so now we use that too.
    Merge of xfs-linux-melb:xfs-kern:26286a by kenmcd.

Perhaps you should learn the history of why certain decisions were

You didn't search for EUCLEAN, did you?

ABI changes cannot be justified this way and you should damn well
know it. Especially as EUCLEAN/EFSCORRUPTED is documented in quite a
few man pages out there:

$ git grep -l EFSCORRUPTED man/
man/man2/ioctl_xfs_ag_geometry.2
man/man2/ioctl_xfs_bulkstat.2
man/man2/ioctl_xfs_fsbulkstat.2
man/man2/ioctl_xfs_fscounts.2
man/man2/ioctl_xfs_fsgetxattr.2
man/man2/ioctl_xfs_fsinumbers.2
man/man2/ioctl_xfs_fsop_geometry.2
man/man2/ioctl_xfs_getbmapx.2
man/man2/ioctl_xfs_getresblks.2
man/man2/ioctl_xfs_goingdown.2
man/man2/ioctl_xfs_inumbers.2
man/man2/ioctl_xfs_scrub_metadata.2

And EUCLEAN is in a few, too. e.g:

$ man ioctl_getfsmap |grep -A 1 EUCLEAN
       EUCLEAN
              The filesystem metadata is corrupt and needs repair.

So, yeah, the EFSCORRUPTED = EUCLEAN horse bolted long ago, and no
amount of retconning will put the genie back in the bottle.

Cheers,

Dave.
