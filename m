For what it's worth, bimfmt_flat (with or without shared library
support) should be simple to implement as a binfmt_misc handler if
anyone needs the old shared library support (or if kernel wanted to
drop it entirely, which I would be in favor of). That's how I handled
old aout binaries I wanted to run after aout was removed: trivial
binfmt_misc loader.
