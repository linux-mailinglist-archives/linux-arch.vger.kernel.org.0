This breaks the basic requirements of asm goto.

If we will do asm goto with outputs, the asm will still be a jump
instruction!  (It is not in LLVM!)

We probably *can* make asm goto have outputs (jump instructions can have
outputs just fine!  Just output reloads on jump instructions are hard,
because not always they are *possible*; but for asm goto it should be
fine).

Doing as LLVM does, and making the asm a "trapping" instruction, makes
it not a jump insn, and opens up whole new cans of worms (including
inferior code quality).  Since it has very different semantics, and we
might want to keep the semantics of asm goto as well anyway, this should
be called something different ("asm break" or "asm __anything" for
example).

It would be nice if they talked to us about it, too.  LLVM claims it
implements the GCC inline asm extension.  It already only is compatible
for the simplest of cases, but this would be much worse still :-(

Sure, that is fine, and quite possible useful, but it is not the same as
asm goto.  asm goto is not some exception handling construct: it is a
jump instruction.

Yes.

I'm just annoyed because of all the extra work created by people not
communicating.
