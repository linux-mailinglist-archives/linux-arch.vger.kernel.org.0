ISTM that reopening a file READ_WRITE shouldn't be unconditionally allowed.
Checking the inode permissions of the file isn't enough to ensure
that the process is allowed to open it.
The 'x' (search) permissions on all the parent directories needs to
be checked (going back as far as some directory the process has open).

If a full pathname is generated this check is done.
But the proposed O_EMTPY_PATH won't be doing it.

This all matters if a system is using restricted directory
permissions to block a process from opening files in some
part of the filesystem, but is also being passed an open
fd (for reading) in that part of the filesystem.
I'm sure there are systems that will be doing this.
